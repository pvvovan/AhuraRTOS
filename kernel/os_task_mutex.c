/**
 * @file os_task_mutex.c
 * @brief Priority inheritance: the boost a mutex owner is owed, and the deadlock check.
 *
 * Split out of os_task.c, which is where this used to live under OS_CONFIG_MUTEX_ENABLE. The
 * algorithm is self-contained - a boost is recomputed from the waiters that justify it, and the
 * recompute walks the blocked_on chain - so it reads better as its own file than as 300 guarded
 * lines inside the scheduler's.
 *
 * The call SITES stay in os_task.c: pausing, deleting or re-prioritising a task all have to tell
 * this layer, and those are one line each at the point they happen.
 *
 * See doc/api.md, "Mutexes and priority inheritance".
