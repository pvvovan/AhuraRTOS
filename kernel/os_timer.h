/*
 * A timer's life cycle, and what each call does to the countdown:
 *
 *   OS_TIMER_DEFINE_PERIODIC / OS_TIMER_DEFINE_ONESHOT   period and callback, at compile time
 *   os_timer_start     run - from the full period, or from where a pause left off
 *   os_timer_restart   run from the full period, whatever the timer was doing
 *                      both carry the context and value the callback will receive
 *   os_timer_pause     halt, keeping the time that was left
 *   os_timer_stop      cancel, discarding both the remaining time and any owed callback
 *   os_timer_period_set    retune the period; the countdown under way is left alone
 *   os_timer_callback_set  point it at a different callback
 *   os_timer_value_set     change the number the callback receives, without restarting
 *
 * There is no init and no delete: nothing is reserved, so os_timer_start cannot fail for want
 * of a resource however many timers are running, and a stopped timer keeps its configuration
 * so it can simply be started again.
 *
 * ALL of them are ISR-safe - each is a short critical section over a list and none blocks.
 * Two caveats. With OS_CONFIG_MAX_SYSCALL_IRQ_PRIORITY set, the interrupt must sit at or below
 * that priority, the rule every ISR-safe call here follows. And the CALLBACK is not ISR
 * context: it runs on the kernel timer task, so it may block, take a mutex or wait on a queue.
 */

/** A timer is set up entirely at COMPILE time, and the macro's NAME is the mode, so there is none
 *  to pass and none to get wrong:
 *
 *    OS_TIMER_DEFINE_PERIODIC(blinker, 500U, on_blink);
 *    OS_TIMER_DEFINE_ONESHOT(timeout,  250U, on_timeout);
 *    os_timer_start(&blinker, &led2, 3U);
 *
 *  What the timer IS is settled here; what a RUN carries - the context and value the callback
 *  receives - is given to os_timer_start. Parameters are prefixed (timer_period_ms) so a caller's
 *  own names cannot be substituted into the field designators. */
