/**
 * @file os_task_internal.h
 * @brief The TCB layout, shared by os_task.c and os_task_mutex.c and by nothing else.
 *
 * Not in os_internal.h on purpose. Every kernel file includes that one, and the scheduler's
 * central data structure has no business being visible to os_queue.c or os_log.c. This header
 * exists because priority inheritance was split into its own translation unit and genuinely
 * needs the layout; keeping it separate is what stops that split widening into a free-for-all.
