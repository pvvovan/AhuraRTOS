 * A queue for messages whose LENGTH varies. Where os_queue_t stores N items of one fixed size, this
 * stores as many messages as fit in a byte budget, each exactly as long as it is:
 *
 *     OS_MSG_DEFINE(cmd_buf, 256U);

 *
 * Reach for it when the length is data rather than a constant, and for a queue when every item is
 * the same struct. Capacity is in BYTES, and each message costs its own length plus a 2-byte
 * header; os_msg_send() adds that itself and answers OS_ERR_FULL when the message does not fit.
 *
 * Messages arrive whole and in order, one per os_msg_receive(): never a fragment, never two joined.
