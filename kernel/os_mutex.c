/**
 * @brief Initialize a mutex object.
 *
 * Re-initializing a mutex that is still in use is refused, for two distinct reasons:
 *
 *   queued waiters   resetting the waiter list would strand the queued tasks on dangling
 *                    intrusive nodes and corrupt the list.
 *   still locked     a locked mutex has its owner_node linked into the OWNER's owned_mutexes
 *                    list (os_task_mutex_owner_link). Clearing owner_node below while the
 *                    owner's head/tail and the neighbouring nodes still point at it breaks that
 *                    list from the outside: the recompute walk in
 *                    os_task_mutex_owner_unlink_and_reprioritize stops early at the cleared node
 *                    and derives a wrong effective priority, os_list_remove takes its
 *                    "already detached" early-out so head/tail are never repaired, and the
 *                    owner's eventual unlock sees locked == false and returns OS_ERR_ERROR -
 *                    leaving the inherited priority boost in place permanently.
 *
 * (The check reads the object's current memory, so first-time init must run on zero-initialized
 * storage - static objects are.)
 *
 * @param[in,out] mutex  Mutex object.
 * @return os_err_t  OK, or BUSY while tasks are waiting on it or it is still held.
