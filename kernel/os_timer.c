/**
 * @file os_timer.c
 * @brief Software timers: expiry is detected by the kernel tick, and callbacks run in FIFO order on
 *        one kernel timer task at OS_CONFIG_TIMER_PRIORITY (the highest priority by default).
 *
 * There is no separate work queue, because a "run this soon" request IS a one-shot timer. Nothing
 * is owned by the kernel, so there is no pool to size and nothing that can be exhausted.
 *
 * Delivery is FIFO. Expiries join os_timer_ready_list in the order the tick notices them and the
 * task takes them from the front, so callbacks never overlap and run in the order they became
 * ready. That is why the list exists: scanning a registry for a flag, as this file used to, runs
 * callbacks in slot order rather than the order they were asked for.

/*
 * The gate every public call in this file passes through first. It rules out three things:
 *
 *   1. Memory that is not a timer. The link state lives inside the object, so a hand-declared
 *      os_timer_t hands the kernel two nodes of garbage, and os_list_remove would store through
 *      node->prev - a write to an address nobody chose, from a plain os_timer_stop. Only the
 *      DEFINE macros set self.
 *
 *   2. A COPY of a real timer, whose list nodes still point into the original. A fixed signature
 *      could not see this; self can, because the copy no longer lives there.
 *
 *   3. A pool entry, which IS a valid timer and would otherwise pass. Arming a free one links its
 *      running_node into the running list while its ready_node is still on the pool's free list,
 *      and the next expiry overwrites the links the free list holds it by.
 *
 * Four bytes per timer and one comparison per call. Being a marker it is a strong heuristic, not a
 * proof: os_timer_unlink_locked is what makes the unlink path provable.
 *
 * Failing it is NOT asserted. Every public call here documents OS_ERR_INVALID_ARG as its answer to
 * a bad argument, which makes that a defined input with a defined result rather than a programming
 * error. The asserts left in this file are internal invariants only.

 * @brief Unlink a node from a list, trusting only the list. Caller holds the critical section.
 *
 * The unlink is the one operation here that can write through a pointer it did not choose:
 * os_list_remove stores through node->prev, so a node holding garbage sends a write to an
 * address nobody picked. Everything else only reads the object or overwrites its fields.
 *
 * So membership is PROVED first. A node the list does not contain is simply not found, and
 * once found its neighbours are known to be the list's own - which is what makes the remove
 * safe, with no marker to match by luck.
 *
 * @param[in,out] list  List to remove from.
 * @param[in,out] node  Node to remove.
 * @return bool  true when the node was a member and has been unlinked.
