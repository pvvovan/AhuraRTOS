/** Clamp a 64-bit tick count into the uint32_t tick range, one short of the OS_WAIT_FOREVER

 *  it turns it into a small, plausible-looking one (and, at the sentinel, into "wait forever"),

 *
 * Distinct from os_arch_soc_idle_cb() and the difference is the whole point: that one waits with
 * NOTHING armed, so only the tick can end it and it may never go deeper than the tick survives.
 * This one is called with the window already open - os_arch_sleep_prepare() has silenced the tick
 * and the package's own timer is counting the wake out - so it may go as deep as THAT timer
 * survives. On an STM32 that is the difference between a WFI and Stop mode.
 *
 * Called with the kernel's interrupt mask held, between os_tickless_pre_sleep_cb() and the elapsed
 * measurement. A WFI - and every HAL Stop entry built on one - still leaves on a pending interrupt
 * while masked, which is exactly how the armed wake ends the window.
 *
 * Whatever the mode costs to leave belongs in os_arch_tick_suppress_min_cb(), so the kernel can
 * refuse a window too short to pay for it. May return spuriously; the idle loop measures what
