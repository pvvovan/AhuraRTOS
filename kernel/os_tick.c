/** The most one window may ever be planned for, whatever the workload and the port say.
 *
 * Not a policy and not configurable: it is a fact about a 32-bit tick counter.
 *
 * os_tickless_expected_idle_ticks_get() answers UINT32_MAX when there is genuinely nothing pending
 * - no timer, no finite-delay sleeper - and that is the honest answer. A port whose wake source is
 * 64 bits wide reports no ceiling of its own for the same honest reason
 * (soc/raspberrypi/rp235x_riscv returns UINT32_MAX: mtime cannot run out). Put together, those two
 * truths would plan a window spanning the entire range of os_tick_count, and then:
 *
 *   - os_tick_announce() does os_tick_count += elapsed. At UINT32_MAX that lands one tick BELOW
 *     where it started, so the clock runs backwards - the one thing a monotonic counter must not
 *     do.
 *   - Every wrap-safe difference in the kernel - os_internal_wait_remaining(), the retry loop in
 *     os_delay_ticks() - reads os_tick_get() - start as a forward elapsed. An unsigned difference
 *     only says "forward" while the real elapsed is under half the range; past that it is
 *     indistinguishable from a small step backwards.
 *
 * Half the range is therefore the bound, and staying strictly under it is what keeps every one of
 * those reads unambiguous. At a 1 kHz tick it is close to 25 days, which is far past any window a
 * real workload asks for - this exists to stop the degenerate case, not to shape ordinary ones.
 *
 * FreeRTOS bounds the same thing with xMaximumPossibleSuppressedTicks, derived in the PORT from the
 * timer's width. This kernel already has that: os_arch_max_suppressed_ticks_get() is exactly it,
 * and every port with a narrow timer answers from its register width. This constant is the other
 * half of the same rule - the limit the KERNEL's own counter imposes once the hardware imposes
 * none. */

 * rather than a deeper mode the kernel could not measure a sleep against.
