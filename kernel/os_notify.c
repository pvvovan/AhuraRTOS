/**
 * @file os_notify.c
 * @brief Direct-to-task notifications: a one-word mailbox built into every task, delivered
 *        without any intermediate object.
 *
 * The lightest signal the kernel offers: no object to create, size or keep alive, since it is
 * addressed to the task itself. One value with overwrite semantics - last give wins - which makes
 * it a signal rather than a stream; use a queue for anything that must not be lost.
 *
 * The mailbox lives in the TCB because it belongs to the task, not to this module: os_task.c hands
 * out the slot and the two facts about a task needed here (current, blocked).

/**
 * @brief Deliver a value to a task's notification mailbox (overwrite: last write wins),
 *        waking it if it is currently blocked in os_notify_wait; ISR-safe.
 *
 * A task blocked for any other reason (delay, mutex/queue/semaphore/event wait) is left
 * alone - the value is only latched for it to pick up on its next os_notify_wait.
 *
 * A NULL task means THIS task, the same shorthand FreeRTOS uses for the calling task, which saves
 * a task from having to keep a handle to itself just to pre-arm its own mailbox. It is refused
 * from an ISR: "this task" there would mean whichever task the interrupt happened to land on, so
 * the kernel will not guess. Note that inside a timer callback it resolves to the kernel timer
 * task, since that is genuinely the task running the callback, and before the scheduler starts it
 * resolves to nothing, which lands on the same INVALID_ARG as a stale handle.
 *
 * @param[in,out] task   Target task, or NULL for the calling task.
 * @param[in]     value  Value to store.
 * @return os_err_t  OK, or INVALID_ARG for a stale handle, or for NULL from an ISR or before any
 *                    task is running.
