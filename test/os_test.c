/**
 * @file os_test.c
 * @brief Boot-time self-test suite for the Ahura RTOS kernel.
 *
 * Supplies os_test() (declared in ahura.h, defined nowhere else in the kernel; not named with the
 * "_cb" suffix - this is where the suite's own code runs, not a kernel query for platform
 * behavior): link this file's library (AhuraRTOS/test, target "os_test") and, when
 * OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE is 1, os_init() creates a task that calls this automatically - no explicit
 * call needed from the application. Runs once, exercises whichever OS_CONFIG_<FEATURE>_ENABLE
 * switches are on, and
 * prints a detailed PASS/FAIL log via printf, finishing with a pass/fail summary. Depends on
 * nothing but ahura.h - no board/HAL headers - so it runs on any arch/board the kernel supports;
 * printf's destination (typically a UART) is the linking application's concern.

 * stack would smash, and a bounded wait so a worker that never finishes is reported rather than
 * left to hang the run. It passes on hardware. Unpinned scheduling is not the broken thing.

 * leave SVC alone. The SUITE is the only part that wants it, and only to reach interrupt context so
 * the ISR-safe APIs can be tested from a real ISR rather than from a task pretending to be one.
 *
 * Claiming it has to be a STRONG definition: CMSIS-Pack startup files declare SVC_Handler weak and
 * alias it to Default_Handler, and between two weak definitions the linker keeps the startup file's
 * - so a weak one here would leave `svc #0` branching into an infinite loop. That is the same
 * mechanism that cost the ST package its SysTick vector.
 *
 * But strong collides with an application that generates its own SVC_Handler, which CubeMX does by
 * default - and it collides as a bare "multiple definition of SVC_Handler" from the linker, which
 * says nothing about why a test suite wants that symbol. Making the application delete a handler it
 * owns, on every regeneration, to accommodate a test, is the wrong way round.
 *
 * So: leave this at 1 and the suite works out of the box on a project with no SVC handler of its
 * own (the Pico SDK, a CubeMX project with SVC unticked). Set it to 0 when the application owns
 * SVC, and call os_test_isr_entry() from that handler instead - one line, and on CubeMX it goes in
 * a USER CODE block, which survives regeneration. Nothing is deleted and nothing collides.
