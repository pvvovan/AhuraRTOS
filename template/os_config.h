/**
 * @file os_config.h
 * @brief Template for the application's os_config.h - every kernel option at its default value.
 *
 * NOT included by the kernel: copy it into the application source tree as os_config.h, adjust the
 * values, and make its directory visible to BOTH the application and the kernel library build
 * (OS_CONFIG_DIR). The full reference is doc/integration.md "Configuration".
 *
 * This file is the single source of configuration, so do not also define OS_CONFIG_ macros from
 * the build system, and do not remove options: an incomplete configuration is rejected at compile
 * time rather than silently misconfiguring the kernel. Two options are OPTIONAL and say so where
 * they appear; everything else is mandatory.
 *
 * Every option carries a short note above it, ending with "Values:" - what may legally go there.
 *
 *   PART 1  CORE      always compiled in; no switch removes any of it. Set these first.
 *   PART 2  FEATURES  one section per feature: its _ENABLE switch and the sizing that switch
 *                     controls. 1 = compiled in, 0 = compiled out, API and RAM with it.
 *   PART 3  PLATFORM  properties of the target. Facts about the silicon - the vector name, the
 *                     spinlock backend - belong to the SoC package instead, not here.
