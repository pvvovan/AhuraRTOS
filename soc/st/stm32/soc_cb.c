/**
 * @file soc_cb.c
 * @brief SoC-owned kernel callbacks for STMicroelectronics STM32.
 *
 * A short file, and deliberately so: CMSIS-Pack startup already gives the kernel its PendSV
 * vector and SystemCoreClock, and single-core parts need no core id, IPI or spinlock.
 *
 * The two tickless sleep hooks are weak, so an application replaces either with its own. The rest
 * is strong on purpose: the kernel and the startup file hold weak defaults for those symbols, and
 * between two weak definitions the linker keeps whichever it reaches first. Nothing is mandatory -
 * with the HAL absent, or the soc_config.h options off, each body compiles to nothing.
 *
 * Tickless idle has no wake source to choose: LIGHT leaves SysTick to the port, which suppresses
 * against it because the core clock still runs; DEEP gates that clock, so the LPTIM driver below
 * takes the window.
 *
 * Not here on purpose: the PendSV vector name (a CubeMX setting, see doc/vendor-notes.md), and
 * programming the tick (the port does that; only the VECTOR is here).
 *
 * Why the package is shaped this way, and what an LPTIM or RTC tick would need on the L and U
 * families: doc/stm32.md, "The SoC package".

 *
 * The kernel asks "wake me in N ticks", then "how many ticks really passed".
 *
 * The counter that answers both never stops and is never reset. It is started once, wraps freely
 * over its full range, and a window is a pair of readings from it; the wake is a compare against
 * the value the window should end at. Everything between the two readings is inside the
 * measurement, the time spent arming included.
 *
 * That last point is the design, and it was learned the hard way. An earlier version restarted the
 * timer for each window, and the restart cost about eighteen LPTIM periods of flag waits - REPOK,
 * ARROK, DIEROK, each up to three low-speed cycles - spent with the counter stopped at zero. Half a
 * millisecond of real time per window that no clock in the system was counting. Over twenty
 * eight-tick windows the kernel clock fell ten ticks behind the CPU's own counter: a 6% error on a
 * short window, and under 1% on a long one, which is why it hid so well. A running counter cannot
 * lose time it is not asked about.
 *
 * So nothing is written to DIER once the timer is going and nothing is ever stopped. Arming is one
 * write to the compare register.
 *
 * The peripheral belongs to CubeMX - clock, LSI or LSE mux, prescaler, handle. This borrows it,
 * takes the NVIC entry because the vector has to reach the kernel, and sets the reload to the full

 *     it is 32, so a "tick" measured against it is 32/32768 s = 976.6 us rather than 1000. Every
 *     window therefore ran the kernel clock 2.4% FAST, while SysTick outside the window kept it
 *     right - an error that changes sign depending on how much of the second was spent asleep.
 *  2. The leftover counts of the final, incomplete tick were dropped: elapsed was a truncating
 *     division and the next window re-read its reference from the counter, so up to a whole tick
 *     went missing per window - this time SLOW. The two did not cancel; their sum moved with the
 *     workload.
 *
 * Scaling by OS_CONFIG_TICK_HZ instead of pre-dividing removes both. A count is worth TICK_HZ
 * units and a tick is worth SOC_CONFIG_TICKLESS_LPTIM_CLOCK_HZ of them, which is exact for every
 * ratio including the ones that are not whole. What is left after the whole ticks are taken out
 * stays here and is spent by a later window, so the announced time converges on the real elapsed
 * time rather than drifting away from it at a fixed rate.
 *

 * kernel clock would simply never advance - the same trap os_arch_soc_init_cb() above records

 * HAL_IncTick() is deliberately absent. The HAL runs off its own timer (CubeMX -> SYS -> Timebase

 *
 * SOC_CONFIG_TICKLESS_LPTIM_CLOCK_HZ is hand-written, and nothing downstream can tell it from the
 * truth: the driver arms in counts and converts the same counts back with the same constant, so a
 * wrong rate makes every window the wrong LENGTH while the arithmetic stays self-consistent. Seen
 * for real on an H743 whose CubeMX project left the mux on the APB at 120 MHz while this option
 * still said 32768 - a clean build, every guard passing, and no symptom to follow.
 *
 * The mux register is read rather than HAL_RCCEx_GetPeriphCLKFreq(), which looks like the obvious
 * call and is not: the H7 implementation has no LPTIM case and answers 0, so on the one family that
 * produced the bug it would check nothing. What the mux says is also more than a rate - a source
 * that is neither LSI nor LSE is refused outright, whatever it runs at, because this file is
 * compiled only for deep sleep and Stop mode gates every other clock the mux offers.
 *
 * Exact, with no tolerance band: LSI_VALUE and LSE_VALUE are nominal numbers from the same headers
 * CubeMX wrote the project against, not measurements, so the two either name one clock or they name
 * two. A band wide enough to be worth having would have let 32768-against-32000 through - 2.4% on
 * every window. A real oscillator's own spread is a different question, invisible here.
 *
 * Runs after HAL_LPTIM_Init(), because the generated MspInit is what programs the mux, and is
 * unconditional rather than an OS_ASSERT: a build with assertions compiled out is the last one that
 * can afford to sleep for the wrong length of time silently. Only LPTIM1 is checked - every family
 * spells the accessor for its other instances differently, and all of them name that one.
