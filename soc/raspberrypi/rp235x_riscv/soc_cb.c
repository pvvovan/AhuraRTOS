/**
 * @file soc_cb.c
 * @brief SoC-owned callbacks for the RP2350 / RP2354 running their Hazard3 RISC-V cores.
 *
 * The RISC-V sibling of ../rp235x_arm: same silicon, different core, almost every answer
 * different - which is why it is a separate package rather than an #if inside that one.
 *
 * PendSV's replacement is SIO_RISCV_SOFTIRQ, which drives mip.MSIP and carries a set and a clear
 * bit PER CORE. So "reschedule me" and "reschedule the other core" are the same write with a
 * different bit, and both callbacks are one line. The datasheet settles the race too: set beats
 * clear on the same cycle, so a request arriving while the handler acknowledges is never lost.
 *
 * The tick comes in as external IRQ 29, not mip.MTIP, and that is not a preference:
 * os_arch_in_isr() reads Hazard3's meicontext, which knows about external IRQs and nothing about
 * MTIP. A tick on cause 7 would run with the kernel believing it was in task context.
 *
 * Tickless idle has no wake source to choose: LIGHT pushes mtimecmp out, and DEEP stops the PLL
 * mtime counts from, so the window moves to the POWMAN timer in the always-on domain - the source
 * the Arm package uses at either depth, shared from ../common.

 * The mechanism is the Arm package's, because it is the chip's rather than the core's: clk_sys is
 * dropped back onto clk_ref, PLL_SYS is powered down, and POWMAN wakes the core. Three things had
 * to be said differently here, and none of them is the sleep itself.
 *
 * PRIMASK becomes mstatus.MIE, through the kernel's own mask API - RISC-V has no priority threshold
 * to leave alone, so there is nothing for a raw register write to protect.
 *
 * The pending-work test becomes mip & mie. On the Arm side that is ICSR for the scheduler
 * exceptions plus NVIC pending-and-enabled; here the scheduler's own request IS an interrupt
 * (MSIP, from SIO's per-core softirq), so one masked read covers both.
 *
 * SEVONPEND and SLEEPDEEP map onto Hazard3's xh3pwr extension rather than onto nothing. SLEEPDEEP
 * only told the Arm core what to do on WFI - the clocks are stopped by writing the clock
 * registers, which is architecture-neutral - and the event register the Arm package uses for the
 * core-1 rendezvous has an exact counterpart here: h3.block / h3.unblock, the OS_ARCH_WFE() /
 * OS_ARCH_SEV() the port supplies. A block wakes on an unblock event, and an unblock received
 * since the last block is latched, closing the same release-versus-block race SEV/WFE closes.
 *
 * What the rendezvous must NOT do on this core is use MSIP for the park or its release. Here the
 * context-switch request and the cross-core doorbell are the same level-sensitive interrupt, so
 * a release sent that way arrives on core 1 indistinguishable from a reschedule - its parked
 * work test sees "work", aborts with an IPI of its own back to core 0, and core 0's MSIP then
 * stands for the whole masked window, where nothing can take the trap that would clear it. Every
 * subsequent WFI returns on the spot, every window measures zero, and the collapsed windows keep
 * the two cores in that phase against each other. h3.unblock carries no interrupt state at all,
 * which is why the park, the request and the release below all go through it, and MSIP is left

 *
 * The softirq clear is the same per-core start-up os_arch_soc_init_cb() gave core 0 from os_init(),
