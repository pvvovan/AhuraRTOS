/**
 * @file soc_powman.h
 * @brief RP235x tickless wake source: the POWMAN always-on timer.
 *
 * Shared by both RP235x packages, and nothing in it is architecture-specific - POWMAN is a chip
 * peripheral and the same silicon carries it either way. Included by a package's own soc_cb.c
 * rather than compiled on its own, so a build that does not use this source carries none of it.
 *
 * The Arm package takes its windows from here whatever the sleep depth: SysTick and the TIMER
 * blocks stop when the clocks do, and this one does not. The RISC-V package uses mtime while the
 * clocks are up and only reaches for this under DEEP, where mtime - clocked from clk_sys - stops
 * with the PLL.
