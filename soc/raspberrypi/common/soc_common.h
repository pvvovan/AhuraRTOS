/**
 * @file soc_common.h
 * @brief Internal interface between the shared Raspberry Pi SoC code and the per-chip packages.
 *
 * NOT a public header: an application never includes this. It exists so soc_common.c and a
 * chip package's soc_cb.c agree on the options, the chip facts and the one function that differs
 * between them.
 *
 * The split is by what the silicon actually decides. Nearly everything the kernel needs from an
 * RP2 chip is identical across the family - the core id, the spinlock, the CPU clock, the SysTick
 * vector, booting core 1 - because it is all SIO or SDK, and SIO is the same block on every one.
 * What differs is precisely one thing: how a core interrupts the other one. The RP2040 has an
 * inter-core FIFO; the RP2350 adds purpose-built doorbells.
 *
 * So the shared file owns everything else and calls soc_ipi_arm(), which each chip package
 * implements against its own hardware, alongside its own os_arch_core_ipi_request_cb().
