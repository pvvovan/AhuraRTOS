/**
 * @file soc_common.c
 * @brief SoC-owned kernel callbacks shared by every Raspberry Pi RP2 chip.
 *
 * Everything the kernel needs from an RP2 chip except one thing: the core id, the kernel spinlock,
 * the CPU clock symbol the SDK does not provide, the SysTick vector, and booting core 1. All of it
 * is SIO or plain SDK, and SIO is the same block on the RP2040 and the RP2350, so it lives here
 * once rather than twice. The exception is how a core interrupts the other - FIFO on the RP2040,
 * doorbells on the RP2350 - which each chip package supplies. See soc_common.h.
 *
 * Compiled INTO whichever chip package the build selected, not into a library of its own, so there
 * is exactly one definition of each symbol in the link.
 *
 * The application still copies template/os_cb.c for its own half of the contract: log output, what
 * a failed assertion does, how a blown stack is reported.
 *
 * Most definitions are weak, so a strong one in the application replaces that callback and leaves
 * the rest. Two are strong and each says why at its own definition: isr_systick and
 * os_arch_soc_init_cb both have to displace a weak definition that is always linked, and between
 * two weak definitions the linker keeps whichever it saw first.
 *
 * Tick source: these packages expect OS_CONFIG_TICK_SOURCE_SYSTICK. Selecting EXTERNAL means
 * supplying os_arch_tick_init_cb() from the application, since the choice of timer is then the
 * application's; the package does not guess one, so the omission is a link error rather than a
 * kernel whose clock never advances.
