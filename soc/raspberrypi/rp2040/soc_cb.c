/**
 * @file soc_cb.c
 * @brief RP2040-specific SoC code: the inter-core interrupt, carried on the SIO FIFO.
 *
 * Everything else the kernel needs from this chip is in ../common/soc_common.c, which is
 * compiled into this package: the core id, the spinlock, the CPU clock, the SysTick vector and
 * booting core 1 are all identical on the RP2040 and the RP2350, because they are SIO or plain
 * SDK either way.
 *
 * What is here is the one genuine difference. The RP2040 has no doorbells, so a core signals the
 * other by pushing a word into the inter-core FIFO and taking that FIFO's IRQ at the far end. The
 * RP2350 package does the same job with a claimed doorbell.
 *
 * And the tickless wake source. The Arm port cannot stretch SysTick here: its reload is the only
 * cycle counter an ARMv6-M core has, and os_delay_us() runs on it. So the port masks the tick
 * interrupt and this package ends the window, on the always-on microsecond timer - 64 bits at a
 * fixed 1 MHz, independent of clk_sys and of SysTick, with one of its four alarms claimed for it.
 * Whole ticks only, both ways: announcing a partial tick would move os_tick_count off the grid.
