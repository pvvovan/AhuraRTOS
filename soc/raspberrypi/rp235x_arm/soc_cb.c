/**
 * @file soc_cb.c
 * @brief RP2350/RP2354-specific SoC code, Arm cores: the inter-core interrupt.
 *
 * Everything else the kernel needs from this chip is in ../common/soc_common.c, which is compiled
 * into this package: the core id, the spinlock, the CPU clock, the SysTick vector and booting
 * core 1 are all identical on the RP2350 and the RP2040, because they are SIO or plain SDK either
 * way.
 *
 * What is here is the one genuine difference today. The RP2350 adds doorbells - a purpose-built
 * inter-core interrupt - so a core signals the other by ringing one, leaving the FIFO free for
 * the SDK and the application. The RP2040 package does the same job through the FIFO because it
 * has no doorbells.
 *
 * This is also where RP2350-only work lands as it arrives, TrustZone first: the Cortex-M33 has
 * the Security Extension and the RP2040's Cortex-M0+ does not, so os_arch_tz_context_save_cb()
 * and os_arch_tz_context_restore_cb() can only ever be implemented on this side of the split.

 * the crystal, which saves more again - and it is also the one where a mistake leaves the core with
 * no clock to execute the restore from, recoverable only through BOOTSEL. clk_ref is deliberately
 * left where it was: the core is running from a known-good oscillator the whole way through, so the
 * restore below cannot fail to have a clock. What is given up is the last slice; what is bought is
 * a sleep that always comes back.
 *
 * An earlier attempt did less than this and said so: zeroing SLEEP_EN0/1 with SLEEPDEEP set gates
 * peripheral clocks but not the generator the core runs from, and the self-test's cycle counter
 * went on counting straight through the sleep - 24 million cycles over 20 windows, exactly a plain
 * WFI. That is why the PLL is stopped here rather than merely asked to idle.
