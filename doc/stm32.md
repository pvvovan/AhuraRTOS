> On a Raspberry Pi Pico instead? The same two installers exist for the Pico SDK
> - see **[AhuraRTOS on Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md)**.

**Everything STM32 in one page:** the [six general installation
steps](installation.md) carried out on real ST hardware, then
[the `st/stm32` SoC package](#the-soc-package) itself. **Three ways to install -
pick one:**

| | Route | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **[Automatic](#automatic---one-command)** - one command | A CubeMX project generated with the **CMake** toolchain. Seconds, shows the diff first, safe to re-run |
| **B** | **[Offline](#offline---no-internet-on-the-machine)** - one command, no network | The same project on a machine with no route out: an air-gapped lab, a locked-down corporate network, a CI agent |
| **C** | **[Manual](#manual---step-by-step)** - eight steps by hand | CubeIDE projects, non-CMake builds, or when you want to make every edit yourself |

All three end in the same place. Verified end to end on a **NUCLEO-H743ZI**,
**NUCLEO-H503RB** and **NUCLEO-G431RB**
(Cortex-M33) and a **NUCLEO-G431RB** (Cortex-M4), built with `arm-none-eabi-gcc`
from the STM32Cube toolchain; the only board-specific names below are the
`stm32h5xx_*` file names and `TIM7`.

ST tooling differs from every other vendor's in exactly two places, and both are
CubeMX checkboxes: it generates its own `PendSV_Handler`, and its HAL takes
SysTick for `HAL_GetTick()`. The automatic route deals with both for you; manual
steps 2 and 3 are where you do it yourself.

---

## Automatic - one command

Run it from the root of your project - the directory holding `CMakeLists.txt`
and the `.ioc`.

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhuraRTOS/AhuraRTOS/main/tools/install_stm32_online.py | python -
```

**Linux and macOS** (bash, zsh):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhuraRTOS/AhuraRTOS/main/tools/install_stm32_online.py | python3 -
```

It prints the exact diff it wants to apply and waits for a `y` before touching
anything. Python 3.8+ and nothing else - no `pip install`, and the script runs
straight out of the pipe, so no installer file is left behind in your project.

> | Where | Setting | Who |
> |---|---|---|
> | **System Core → SYS → Timebase Source** | anything but SysTick - a spare `TIM` | **you**, before running it |

### What it does

Exactly the manual steps below, in the same order:

| Step | |
|---|---|
| 1 | Puts the AhuraRTOS repository at `AhuraRTOS/` in your project |
| 2 | Removes a generated `PendSV_Handler` or `SysTick_Handler`, and clears the box that produced it in the `.ioc` |
| 3 | Checks the HAL time base is off SysTick, and stops if it is not |
| 4 | Copies `os_config.h`, `os_cb.c` and `os_main.c` into `Core/` |
| 5 | Appends the kernel block to the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` |
| 6 | Adds `#include "ahura.h"` to the interrupt file (the tick vector is the SoC package's) |
| 7 | Calls `os_init()` / `os_start()` at the end of `main()` |
| 8 | Leaves the build to you |

### Options

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Print the diff and stop. Writes nothing |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip the confirmation |
| `--app-dir DIR` | Which source tree to install into, on a dual-core part |
| `--tick external` | Drive `os_tick_handler()` from your own timer instead of SysTick |
| `--ref REF` | Branch or tag to download (default: `main`) |
| `--project DIR` | Project root (default: the current directory) |
| `--source PATH` | Use this checkout instead of downloading |
| `--update` | Replace an `AhuraRTOS/` already in the project with the current version |
| `--force-templates` | Overwrite an existing `os_config.h` / `os_cb.c` / `os_main.c` |
| `--uninstall` | Take the whole integration back out |

They go after the `-`, which is where the pipe leaves room for the script's own
arguments:

```bash
curl -fsSL .../tools/install_stm32_online.py | python3 - --dry-run
```

### Running it twice

Nothing happens twice. Each run works out what is already in place and fills in
only what is missing:

| Already there | What the next run does |
|---|---|
| `AhuraRTOS/` | Left exactly as it is - `--update` replaces it |
| `os_config.h`, `os_cb.c`, `os_main.c` | Kept, never overwritten - they are yours the moment they exist |
| The CMake block, the tick, the boot calls | Rebuilt at the correct anchor, so a call that was moved or lost comes back |

With everything in place it does no work and no network access at all, and says
so. That last row is also the repair: if CubeMX regenerates over the
integration, or a block gets deleted by hand, run the command again.

### What it will not do

**It never opens the `.ioc`.** That file is what CubeMX generates *from*, and
every fact the script needs is in the generated sources - which is also all the
compiler ever sees.

**It never overwrites your three files.** Once `os_config.h`, `os_cb.c` and
`os_main.c` exist they are yours, edits and all.

**It never loses code it disables.** A generated `PendSV_Handler` is wrapped in
`#if 0` rather than deleted, because the kernel's port defines that symbol and
two definitions are a link error. `--uninstall` restores it verbatim.

Every C edit it makes goes inside a CubeMX `USER CODE` section, so regeneration
keeps it. The one exception is that `PendSV_Handler`, because CubeMX owns the
function and offers no section inside it - so regenerating brings the stub back,
and re-running the installer disables it again. To stop it being generated at
all, do [manual step 2](#2-cubemx-stop-generating-pendsv_handler-and-systick_handler) once.

It stops with an explanation, **before writing anything**, if the HAL still owns
SysTick or if FreeRTOS is already in the project. The fix is a CubeMX checkbox
in both cases, and the message names it.

Installed? Go straight to **[Build and flash](#8-build-and-flash)**.

## Offline - no internet on the machine

Same installation, same six steps, same result - the only difference is where
the kernel comes from. `install_stm32_offline.py` never touches the network: it
uses a copy of the repository already on the machine, and it does not import
`urllib`, `tarfile` or `socket` to do it.

Use it on an air-gapped lab machine, behind a corporate proxy that blocks
GitHub, or on a build agent with no route out.

> The three CubeMX settings from the [automatic route](#automatic---one-command)
> apply here unchanged. This installer writes the same code and edits the `.ioc`
> just as little.

### 1. Get the repository, on a machine that has a connection

Either a clone or the green **Code → Download ZIP** button:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhuraRTOS/AhuraRTOS.git
```

### 2. Copy it into your project and run it

```text
MyProject/
├── CMakeLists.txt        <- the top-level one CubeMX generated
├── MyProject.ioc
├── Core/
└── AhuraRTOS/            <- the repository you copied in
    ├── ahura.h
    ├── kernel/  arch/  soc/  template/
    └── tools/install_stm32_offline.py
```

```bash
cd MyProject
python3 AhuraRTOS/tools/install_stm32_offline.py
```

That is the whole procedure. It finds the kernel beside itself, reads the
project, prints the same diff and waits for a `y` - exactly like the online
installer, because it *is* the online installer: everything that reads the
project, computes the edits and writes them with rollback is imported from
`install_stm32_online.py`. Only the "where does the kernel come from" step differs, so
the two cannot drift apart.

A ZIP download unpacks as `AhuraRTOS-main/` rather than `AhuraRTOS/`. That works
too - it is found under either name, and installed to `AhuraRTOS/` so the CMake
block matches what the online installer would have written.

### Where it looks for the kernel

In this order, most explicit first, stopping at the first real checkout:

| | Location |
|---|---|
| 1 | `--source PATH`, if given. A path that is not a checkout is an **error**, never a reason to keep looking - silently installing some other copy is how the wrong kernel version ends up in a build |
| 2 | The checkout this script is running from |
| 3 | `<project>/AhuraRTOS` |
| 4 | `<project>/AhuraRTOS*` - a ZIP still under its branch name |
| 5 | Next to the project, one level up, under either name - for when several projects share one downloaded copy |

If none of them holds a kernel it says so and stops. It will not download one;
that is the entire point of this script.

### Already in the right place

Offline, the source and the destination are routinely the **same directory**:
the repository is at `<project>/AhuraRTOS`, which is exactly where the installer
would otherwise copy it. Copying a directory onto itself is not a copy - the
destination is cleared first, so it would destroy the source.

So "already in place" is treated as nothing to copy, and any copy whose source
and destination resolve to one path is refused. Symlinks, junctions and
Windows paths differing only in case are all resolved before that comparison, so
none of them slips past as a different directory.

```text
  note: the kernel is already at AhuraRTOS/ - installed in place, nothing copied
```

### Offline options

The same as the online installer, minus `--ref` - there is nothing to fetch:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Print the diff and stop. Writes nothing |
| `--yes` | Skip the confirmation |
| `--source PATH` | Use this checkout, wherever it is |
| `--project DIR` | Project root (default: the current directory) |
| `--app-dir DIR` | Which source tree to install into, on a dual-core part |
| `--tick external` | Drive `os_tick_handler()` from your own timer instead of SysTick |
| `--update` | Refresh `AhuraRTOS/` in the project from `--source` |
| `--force-templates` | Overwrite an existing `os_config.h` / `os_cb.c` / `os_main.c` |
| `--uninstall` | Take the whole integration back out |

`--uninstall` needs no kernel at all - it only removes managed blocks and the
installed directory - so it keeps working on a machine where the original
download has since been deleted.

---

## Manual - step by step

The same result by hand: eight steps, because two of the six general ones are
CubeMX settings rather than code.

### 1. Add the kernel to the project

From the project root (the directory holding `CMakeLists.txt` and the `.ioc`),
copy a clone of AhuraRTOS in as `AhuraRTOS/`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhuraRTOS/AhuraRTOS.git AhuraRTOS
rm -rf AhuraRTOS/.git      # or keep it, and update with git pull
```

Or track the whole repository as a submodule instead, if you would rather
updates be a `git pull`:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/AhuraRTOS/AhuraRTOS.git AhuraRTOS
```

Both put the tree at `AhuraRTOS/`, which is the path every CMake line
below uses. See [Installation → Step 1](installation.md#step-1---get-the-source)
for the details and [Keeping the kernel up to
date](installation.md#keeping-the-kernel-up-to-date) for later.

### 2. CubeMX: stop generating `PendSV_Handler` and `SysTick_Handler`

> **System Core → NVIC → Code generation tab → clear "Generate IRQ handler" for
> *Pendable request for system service* and for *System tick timer*.**

The kernel defines both itself, so a generated stub is a
`multiple definition of 'PendSV_Handler'` at link time. Delete it by hand and the
next code generation puts it back; the checkbox is in the `.ioc`, so it sticks.

**Clear *System service call via SWI instruction* too** if you will run the
[self-test](self-test.md) - the suite defines `SVC_Handler`. (An application that
needs `SVC` for itself can share it instead: see
[the self-test](self-test.md#turning-it-on).)

The tab when you are done - everything at its default except the three cleared
rows:

| Row | Generate IRQ handler |
|---|---|
| Non maskable interrupt, Hard fault, Memory management fault, Pre-fetch fault, Undefined instruction, Debug monitor | ✔ default |
| **System service call via SWI instruction** (`SVC_Handler`) | ☐ **clear it** - see above |
| **Pendable request for system service** (`PendSV_Handler`) | ☐ **clear it** - the kernel owns this vector |
| **System tick timer** (`SysTick_Handler`) | ☐ **clear it** - the SoC package owns this vector |
| Time base: *<your timer>* global interrupt | ✔ appears once step 3 is done - CubeMX ticks it for you |

The *Select for init sequence ordering* and *Call HAL handler* columns are not
involved; leave them as they are.

> **On the installer route?** It clears all three boxes for you, in the `.ioc` and
> in the generated file. `PendSV` and `SysTick` it insists on - they are link errors
> either way - and it stops and asks if your `USER CODE` block inside one of them
> holds anything. `SVC` it only clears when the stub is empty: write code in there
> and it stays yours, with a note about `OS_CONFIG_TEST_SVC_VECTOR` for later.

### 3. CubeMX: move the HAL time base off SysTick

> **System Core → SYS → Timebase Source → any spare timer.**

Otherwise `HAL_Init()` claims SysTick, and the kernel needs it. Any spare timer
will do - the kernel never touches it. This page says `TIM7`; substitute yours.

CubeMX handles the rest itself: the time-base file, that timer's `IRQHandler`,
and its NVIC row.

Now **Project → Generate Code**, then check `Core/Src/stm32h5xx_it.c`:

| Should be gone | Should be there |
|---|---|
| `PendSV_Handler` (and `SVC_Handler`, if you cleared it) | `SysTick_Handler`, with no `HAL_IncTick()` in it |
| | your time-base timer's `IRQHandler` |

> `HAL_Delay()` busy-waits; it does not yield. Use `os_delay_ms()` in tasks and
> keep `HAL_Delay()` for driver init before `os_start()`.

### 4. Copy the three files

```bash
cp AhuraRTOS/template/os_config.h Core/Inc/os_config.h
cp AhuraRTOS/template/os_cb.c     Core/Src/os_cb.c
cp AhuraRTOS/template/os_main.c   Core/Src/os_main.c
```

Then fill in `os_cb.c`. On a Nucleo, `printf` already reaches the ST-LINK COM
port through the BSP, so the three callbacks are short:

```c
#include "main.h"
#include "ahura.h"

void os_assert_failed_cb(const char *file, uint32_t line)
{
    printf("\r\nOS_ASSERT failed at %s:%lu\r\n", (file != NULL) ? file : "?", line);
    if ((CoreDebug->DHCSR & CoreDebug_DHCSR_C_DEBUGEN_Msk) != 0U) { __BKPT(0); }
}

void os_stack_overflow_cb(const char *task_name)
{
    printf("\r\nStack overflow in task '%s'\r\n", (task_name != NULL) ? task_name : "?");
    if ((CoreDebug->DHCSR & CoreDebug_DHCSR_C_DEBUGEN_Msk) != 0U) { __BKPT(0); }
}

#if (OS_CONFIG_LOG_ENABLE == 1U) && (OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE == 0U)
void os_log_output_cb(const uint8_t *data, size_t length)
{
    (void)HAL_UART_Transmit(&hcom_uart[COM1], (uint8_t *)data, (uint16_t)length, HAL_MAX_DELAY);
}
#endif
```

The template's other blocks - tick, TrustZone, multi-core, tickless - are each
guarded by the `#if` of the feature they belong to. Delete them or leave them;
both compile.

`os_main.c` is the application. To blink the user LED:

```c
#include "main.h"
#include "ahura.h"

void os_main(void)
{
    while (1)
    {
        BSP_LED_Toggle(LED_GREEN);
        os_delay_ms(500U);
    }
}
```

### 5. Edit the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`

CubeMX generates this file once and never regenerates it, so these edits are
permanent.

You could scatter them through the generated blocks - the kernel next to
`add_subdirectory(cmake/stm32cubemx)`, the two sources under `# Add user sources
here`, the library under `# Add user defined libraries`. **Append one block at
the end of the file instead.** `target_sources()` and `target_link_libraries()`
both *append*, so a later call adds to what the generated blocks already set;
the executable target is created near the top, which is the only ordering that
matters. Everything the kernel needs then sits in one place to read, copy to the
next project, or delete, and the generated blocks stay byte-for-byte as CubeMX
wrote them:

```cmake
# ***********************************************************************************************
# AhuraRTOS
# ***********************************************************************************************

# OS_CONFIG_DIR must be set BEFORE add_subdirectory: the kernel library and the
# application have to compile against the same os_config.h.
set(OS_CONFIG_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Core/Inc)
add_subdirectory(AhuraRTOS)

# Editing os_config.h re-runs CMake by itself (see the self-test page).
set_property(DIRECTORY APPEND PROPERTY CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS ${OS_CONFIG_DIR}/os_config.h)

# Link the self-test suite iff os_config.h asks for it.
file(READ ${OS_CONFIG_DIR}/os_config.h _os_config_contents)
if(_os_config_contents MATCHES "#define[ \t]+OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE[ \t]+1")
    message(STATUS "Ahura self-test suite: ENABLED (os_main() is not run in this build)")
    add_subdirectory(AhuraRTOS/test)
    set(AHURA_TEST_LIB os_test)
else()
    set(AHURA_TEST_LIB "")
endif()
unset(_os_config_contents)

# Application-owned kernel files: the APPLICATION build, never the kernel library.
target_sources(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE
    Core/Src/os_cb.c
    Core/Src/os_main.c
)

target_link_libraries(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}
    ahura_kernel
    ${AHURA_TEST_LIB}   # empty unless OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE is 1, see above
)
```

That is the whole build change. The middle two stanzas are explained in
[One switch instead of two](self-test.md#one-switch-instead-of-two); drop them
and the block still works, at the cost of switching the test suite on in two
places by hand.

### 6. Add the include to `Core/Src/stm32h5xx_it.c`

Add this, inside the `USER CODE` markers so CubeMX keeps it:

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
#include "ahura.h"
/* USER CODE END Includes */
```

That is the whole step. You write no `SysTick_Handler` - the `st/stm32` package
already defines one.

> Want the tick vector yourself? `SOC_CONFIG_SYSTICK_VECTOR = 0` in
> `soc_config.h`, then write `SysTick_Handler` and call `os_tick_handler()` from
> it. A different timer entirely is `OS_CONFIG_TICK_SOURCE_EXTERNAL`.

### 7. Boot the kernel in `Core/Src/main.c`

Again inside the markers, after the peripherals the kernel's callbacks depend on
are initialized - on a Nucleo that means after `BSP_COM_Init()`, or the first
log line goes nowhere:

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
#include "ahura.h"
/* USER CODE END Includes */

  /* ... HAL_Init(), SystemClock_Config(), MX_*_Init(), BSP_COM_Init() ... */

  /* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
  os_init();
  os_start();   /* never returns */

  while (1)
  {
    /* USER CODE END WHILE */
```

The generated `while (1)` below is now unreachable; leaving it in place keeps
the `USER CODE` markers intact for CubeMX.

### 8. Build and flash

With the STM32 VS Code extension, the usual **CMake: Build** is enough. From a
shell, with `arm-none-eabi-gcc`, `cmake` and `ninja` on `PATH` (STM32CubeCLT
provides all three):

```bash
cmake --preset Debug
cmake --build build/Debug
```

The configure log should end with the kernel naming its port:

```text
-- Ahura kernel arch: arm/cortex_m33
Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
             RAM:        7856 B        32 KB     23.97%
           FLASH:       35320 B       128 KB     26.95%
```

Flash it with CubeProgrammer, the CubeIDE debugger, or:

```bash
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD -w build/Debug/ahura.elf -rst
```

The green LED blinks at 1 Hz, and COM1 (115200 8N1 on the ST-LINK VCP) carries
whatever `OS_LOG_*` emits.

---

## The SoC package

### Why it is so short

STM32 asks less of a SoC package than most parts, and the near-empty file is the
answer rather than an unfinished one. Every STM32 uses CMSIS-Pack startup files,
so the PendSV vector already carries the kernel's default name and
`SystemCoreClock` already exists and is maintained by the generated
`SystemInit()`. Single-core parts need no core id, no inter-core IPI and no
hardware spinlock. What is left is the handful of callbacks in `soc_cb.c`.

The two tickless sleep hooks, `os_tickless_pre_sleep_cb()` and
`os_tickless_post_sleep_cb()`, are **weak**: a strong definition anywhere in the
application replaces that hook and leaves the rest of the package in place. The
rest of the file is strong on purpose - the kernel and the CMSIS startup file
already hold weak defaults for those symbols, and between two weak definitions
the linker keeps whichever it reaches first. Nothing is mandatory: with the HAL
absent, or with the options in `soc_config.h` turned off, each body compiles to
nothing and the kernel behaves exactly as it does with no package at all.

Options live in `soc_config.h`, copied from `template/soc_config.h` into
`Core/Inc` beside `os_config.h`. The file and every option in it are required on
the same terms as `os_config.h`: a missing option is a compile error, never a
silent default.

Two things are deliberately **not** in the package:

- **The PendSV vector name.** CubeMX generating a competing `PendSV_Handler` is a
  project problem, fixed in the `.ioc` rather than in code - see
  [Vendor notes](vendor-notes.md). The installer applies it for you.
- **Programming the tick.** `OS_CONFIG_TICK_SOURCE_SYSTICK` is the right answer
  on almost every STM32, and the port sets SysTick's reload itself. The *vector*
  is in the package, and CubeMX's own `SysTick_Handler` has to be turned off.

  The low-power **L and U families are the exception**: SysTick stops in STOP
  mode there, so they want an LPTIM or RTC tick instead. That is
  `os_arch_tick_init_cb()`, and it is family-specific enough to belong to the
  application until this package grows a per-family layer (see **E6** in
  `AUDIT.md`).


```cmake
set(AHURA_SOC st/stm32)
```

One package covers every STM32, from a C0 to an H7, and it is deliberately
small: **CMSIS-Pack startup files already give the kernel most of what it
needs.** The PendSV vector already carries `PendSV_Handler`, the kernel's
default; `SystemCoreClock` is already defined and kept current by the generated
`SystemInit()`; and single-core parts need no core id, no IPI and no spinlock.
STM32 is the kernel's primary bring-up target precisely because it asks so
little.

**Layout:**

| | |
|---|---|
| `soc_cb.c` | The whole package: a clock refresh at start-up, the SysTick vector, the LPTIM wake source for deep sleep, and two tickless sleep hooks. Only the two hooks are `OS_WEAK`, so an application that wants its own simply defines them |
| `template/soc_config.h` | Nine options, copied beside your `os_config.h` |

There is no public header, because the package has nothing for the application
to call - every entry point is a `_cb` the kernel invokes itself.

`AHURA_SOC_ARCH` is deliberately **not** set. The core varies across the range -
M0+ on C0/G0/L0, M4 on F4/L4/G4, M7 on F7/H7, M33 on H5/U5/WBA - and CubeMX
always puts a `-mcpu` in `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` for the kernel's own detection to read,
so a value here could only be wrong.

**What it supplies:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Context-switch vector** | Nothing to supply. CMSIS-Pack startup already names it `PendSV_Handler`, which is the kernel's default - but CubeMX will *generate its own* unless told not to, and that one wins at link time. This is step [2. CubeMX: stop generating `PendSV_Handler`](#2-cubemx-stop-generating-pendsv_handler-and-systick_handler) |
| **Tick** | Nothing to supply, but the HAL competes for SysTick and must be moved off it. This is step [3. CubeMX: move the HAL time base off SysTick](#3-cubemx-move-the-hal-time-base-off-systick) |
| **`SystemCoreClock`** | Already defined by CMSIS-Pack. The package refreshes it in `os_arch_soc_init_cb()` before the kernel programs its tick, so a clock tree brought up after `SystemInit()` is still reflected. `SOC_CONFIG_CLOCK_AUTO_UPDATE 0` turns that off |
| **Core id** | Not needed - single-core parts |
| **IPI** | Not needed - single-core parts |
| **Spinlock** | Not needed - the kernel's own backend is correct on one core |
| **Tickless hooks** | `os_tickless_pre_sleep_cb()` / `os_tickless_post_sleep_cb()` suspend and resume the HAL timebase, so a suppressed sleep is not cut short at that timer's period. `SOC_CONFIG_TICKLESS_HAL_TICK 0` turns that off |
| **Tickless wake source** | Under `OS_CONFIG_TICKLESS_DEEP_ENABLE 1` an LPTIM clocked from LSI or LSE counts the window out, because Stop mode gates SysTick. At boot the package reads the RCC mux and refuses to run unless it really selects the rate `SOC_CONFIG_TICKLESS_LPTIM_CLOCK_HZ` declares - a wrong rate is otherwise invisible, since arming and measuring use the same number. `SOC_CONFIG_TICKLESS_LPTIM_CALIBRATE 1` measures the real rate against the core clock at start-up instead of trusting the declared one |
| **HAL include path** | The kernel library compiles `soc_cb.c`, which includes `main.h` - CubeMX generates one for every project and it pulls in that family's HAL header itself. The package links CubeMX's `stm32cubemx` INTERFACE target when it exists, so the kernel sees the same HAL tree the application does |

Everything here degrades to nothing when the HAL is absent, which is what makes
the package safe on a hand-written project: `SOC_CONFIG_CLOCK_AUTO_UPDATE` and
`SOC_CONFIG_TICKLESS_HAL_TICK` at `0` compile both HAL-touching bodies away.

**Why it exists at all**, given how little it contributes:

1. **To say so.** "STM32 needs almost no SoC glue" is worth stating where it can
   be checked, rather than left to be inferred from an absence.
2. **For the installers.** `install_stm32_online.py` and `install_rpi_online.py`
   write the same shape of CMake block, with one `AHURA_SOC` line that differs
   only in its value.
3. **As the landing site** for the STM32-specific work that is genuinely coming:
   an **LPTIM or RTC tick** for the low-power L and U families, where SysTick
   stops in STOP mode - the same problem Nordic has, and the reason
   `OS_CONFIG_TICK_SOURCE_EXTERNAL` exists; and the **dual-core H7 parts**
   (Cortex-M7 plus Cortex-M4), which are asymmetric - two kernels, or one kernel
   and bare-metal - not the shared ready lists `OS_CONFIG_CORE_COUNT` describes,
   so that needs a design decision before it needs code.

**Status** - verified end to end on three boards, one per core the range uses:
**NUCLEO-H743ZI** (Cortex-M7), **NUCLEO-H503RB** (M33) and **NUCLEO-G431RB**
(M4). The full self-test
passes on silicon, both from the one-command installer and from the manual
route. Single-core only. Tickless idle is driven by the idle task here as everywhere;
this package adds Stop mode with an LPTIM ending the window, selected with
`OS_CONFIG_TICKLESS_DEEP_ENABLE`.

## What regeneration touches

| File | Owner | Survives CubeMX regeneration |
|---|---|---|
| `Core/Inc/os_config.h`, `Core/Src/os_cb.c`, `Core/Src/os_main.c` | you | yes - CubeMX does not know they exist |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | you, after the first generation | yes - generated once only |
| `Core/Src/stm32h5xx_it.c`, `Core/Src/main.c` | CubeMX | yes, **if** the edits are inside `USER CODE` markers |
| `PendSV_Handler` and `SVC_Handler` staying absent, TIM7 time base | the `.ioc` | yes - all three are stored settings, not hand edits |

If a regeneration does lose something, the
[automatic installer](#automatic---one-command) puts it back - running it again
is the repair, whichever route you used the first time.
