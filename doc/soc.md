# SoC packages

[← Back to the documentation index](README.md) · [Porting](porting.md) · [Platforms](platforms.md)

A SoC package supplies the part of the kernel's callback contract that is a
**fact about the silicon** rather than a decision about the product. It is
optional: without one the kernel builds exactly as it always has, and the
application writes that group itself.

```cmake
set(AHURA_SOC raspberrypi/rp235x_arm)
add_subdirectory(AhuraRTOS)
```

That is the whole integration. The application still links `ahura_kernel` and
nothing else.

---

## Why the layer exists

Nothing in the kernel or the ports names a vendor, and that stays true. What
changed is that the callbacks a multi-core or non-CMSIS part needs used to be
hand-written into every project's `os_cb.c`, from the datasheet, every time. A
package is that work done once, in the tree, where it can be reviewed and
reused.

The seam itself is not new. The kernel already routed every SoC-specific
behaviour through `_cb` callbacks; a package fills a hole that was already
there rather than opening one.

## Where does it belong: arch, soc, or os_config?

Three homes, and one question each. Ask them in order and the answer is
usually forced:

| Home | The question | The test |
|---|---|---|
| `arch/` | **What instruction set?** | It changes when you swap a Cortex-M33 for a Hazard3, on the same chip |
| `soc/` | **What chip?** | It changes when you swap an RP2350 for an STM32H5, with the same core |
| `os_config.h` | **What does this product need?** | It changes between two products built on the same chip |

Worked examples, because the boundaries are not always where they first look:

- **The context switch** is `arch`. It is the instruction set's exception
  frame, and every Cortex-M shares it whoever made the silicon.
- **The core id** is `soc`. Cortex-M has no architectural core-id register at
  all, which is exactly why the kernel has to ask.
- **The PendSV vector *name*** is `soc`, though the vector itself is `arch`.
  The exception is architectural; what the startup file calls it is a property
  of the SDK that shipped with the chip.
- **The number of cores** splits across two homes, and the split is the point.
  How many the chip *has* is a `soc` fact (`SOC_CORE_COUNT`). How many the
  kernel should *schedule on* is an application decision
  (`OS_CONFIG_CORE_COUNT`) - running single-core on a dual-core chip is
  entirely reasonable. The package validates the choice against the fact.
- **Starting a secondary core** is `soc`. There is no architectural way to do
  it: it is a reset release, a mailbox handshake, a boot-address register,
  different on every chip. The kernel can say *when* and never *how*, which is
  why `os_start()` calls `os_arch_core_launch_cb()` rather than doing it.
- **TrustZone mode** is `os_config.h`. Whether the core *has* the Security
  Extension is `arch` (`OS_ARCH_HAS_TRUSTZONE`), but which state the kernel
  runs in is a product decision, and the kernel `#error`s when the two
  disagree.
- **The tick source** is `os_config.h`, defaulted by `soc`. Whether SysTick
  survives the sleep modes a chip ships with is a silicon fact, so a package
  may set `OS_CONFIG_TICK_SOURCE` through its `soc.cmake`; whether the product
  uses those modes is still the application's call, and it can override.

The rule that catches most mistakes: **if two boards using the same chip would
answer differently, it is `os_config.h`. If two chips with the same core would
answer differently, it is `soc`. Otherwise it is `arch`.**

## Who owns what

The callback contract splits in two, and the split is the whole design:

| Application owns (`template/os_cb.c`) | SoC owns (a package, or `template/soc_cb.c`) |
|---|---|
| `os_log_output_cb` - which transport? | `os_arch_core_id_get_cb` |
| `os_assert_failed_cb` - report how? | `os_arch_core_ipi_request_cb` |
| `os_stack_overflow_cb` | `os_arch_spinlock_acquire_cb` / `_release_cb` |
| | `os_arch_handler_stack_top_cb` / `_limit_cb` (multi-core) |
| | `os_arch_tick_init_cb` |
| | `os_arch_tz_context_save_cb` / `_restore_cb` |
| | `os_tickless_pre_sleep_cb` / `_post_sleep_cb` |
| | the `SystemCoreClock` symbol, where the SDK omits it |

Two configuration values move with the second group, and are therefore **not in
`os_config.h`**:

- `OS_CONFIG_ARCH_PENDSV_HANDLER` - the vector symbol name.
- `OS_CONFIG_SPINLOCK_SOC_BACKEND` - whether the spinlock uses `LDREX`/`STREX`
  or the callbacks.

### Why those two had to move

Not tidiness. `os_arch_port_common.h` includes `os_config.h`, so anything
defined in the application's configuration is seen **after** the build system's
`-D`. A stale `#define OS_CONFIG_ARCH_PENDSV_HANDLER PendSV_Handler` left in a
project's config therefore silently overrides a package that set `isr_pendsv`,
and the kernel traps at `os_start()` with the vector check pointing at a
handler that was never linked. The same shape of bug on the spinlock gives a
lock that excludes nothing.

Both keep `#ifndef` defaults in `os_arch_port_common.h`, so a project with no
package, or an older config that still defines them, builds and behaves exactly
as before.

## The one-definition rule

> Exactly one definition of each SoC-owned callback is reachable at link time.

This is the rule that makes the split safe, and the reason
`template/soc_cb.c` is a separate file rather than a section of
`template/os_cb.c`.

The linker pulls a member out of a static archive only when it defines a symbol
that is currently **undefined**. Every SoC-owned callback is called by the
kernel and defaulted nowhere, so the reference is unresolved and the definition
is always pulled in. But if an application also carries an empty weak stub -
compiled straight into the executable, not into an archive - then the symbol is
already defined by the time the linker looks, the package's real implementation
is never extracted, and the stub wins **in silence**. On SMP that reads as every
core reporting id 0, which corrupts shared state rather than failing to build.

Hence:

- A package defines the group. An application using a package does **not** copy
  `template/soc_cb.c` - and cannot do so by accident: every SoC-owned callback in
  the template is strong, so a copy next to a package fails to link with a
  `multiple definition` error naming the callback.
- A package's SoC-owned callbacks are strong too, wherever the kernel, the port
  or a startup file already holds a weak default: between two weak definitions
  the linker keeps whichever it reaches first. Code shared by sibling packages
  under `../common` may give a weak default that one package replaces.
- The hooks an application is meant to replace - `os_tickless_pre_sleep_cb()`,
  `os_tickless_post_sleep_cb()`, and `soc_deep_sleep_allowed_cb()` on the RP2350
  - are `OS_WEAK`, so a normal definition in the application's own sources wins.
  Each belongs in the chip's own `soc_cb.c`, never in `../common`: only one chip
  package is ever compiled, so the build holds exactly one weak definition and
  the application's is the only other one the linker can see. Two weak copies -
  one shared, one per-chip - would leave the choice to link order.
- A package's sources are compiled into `ahura_kernel` rather than into an
  archive of their own, which is what keeps the guarantee above simple.

## Layout

```
soc/<vendor>/<family>/
├── soc.cmake        # required
├── soc.h            # only if the package exposes something to call; most do not
│
└── ../common/       # optional: code shared by sibling packages of one vendor,
                     # compiled into whichever one the build selected
└── soc_cb.c         # optional: the SoC-owned callbacks
```

The package's own page - what it assumes, what it claims, what has run on
silicon - lives in [`doc/`](README.md#the-soc-packages) with the
rest of the documentation, not beside the sources.

Vendor names use the standard vendor prefixes - `raspberrypi`, `infineon`,
`nordic`, `silabs` - the same list Zephyr's `soc/` tree uses, so anyone arriving
from there already knows where to look. The family level is kept even when a
vendor has effectively one family, so `AHURA_SOC` values and the CMake dispatch
never need a special case.

Board-level detail - pin mux, LEDs, which UART is the console - is deliberately
**not** here. That is application territory, and it is where a tree like this
starts to sprawl.

## `soc.cmake`

Read by `CMakeLists.txt` **before** the `ahura_kernel` target is
finished, which is why the dispatch lives inside the kernel rather than beside
it: the PendSV name has to be known while the port's `.c` files compile, since
they paste it into naked assembly. The application never has to get an
`add_subdirectory()` order right.

Every variable is optional except the name. Unset means "the kernel's default".

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AHURA_SOC_NAME` | Human-readable, for the configure-time status line |
| `AHURA_SOC_PENDSV_HANDLER` | Vector symbol name, if not `PendSV_Handler` |
| `AHURA_SOC_SPINLOCK_BACKEND` | `1` to force the callback spinlock backend |
| `AHURA_SOC_ARCH` | Core folder under `arch/<family>/`, e.g. `cortex_m33` |
| `AHURA_SOC_SOURCES` | Absolute paths; use `${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}` |
| `AHURA_SOC_INCLUDE_DIRS` | Added `PUBLIC` to `ahura_kernel` |
| `AHURA_SOC_LINK_LIBRARIES` | Vendor SDK targets the sources need |
| `AHURA_SOC_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` | Anything else the target requires |

## Writing one

The path is deliberately the same work twice rather than two jobs:

1. Copy `template/soc_cb.c` into an application as `soc_cb.c` and
   fill in the bodies against the target's registers. Get the board running.
2. Move the finished file to `soc/<vendor>/<family>/soc_cb.c`, add a
   `soc.cmake` stating the build facts, and write `doc/soc-<family>.md` saying
   what it assumes and what it claims.

Step 1 alone is a complete, supported port - step 2 only makes it reusable.

Be honest on that page about what has run on silicon and what has only
compiled, and treat "it builds" as saying nothing about the second. Every RP2
package now states which it is, and the RP2040's page is worth reading as a
warning: four bugs sat in it for as long as it had never been run, one of them
an assembler error, because nothing had ever asked a compiler to look at it.

## Packaged today

| `AHURA_SOC` | Parts | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [`raspberrypi/rp235x_arm`](raspberry-pi.md#the-rp2350-arm-package) | RP2350, RP2354 - Arm cores (Pico 2) | `isr_pendsv`, `isr_systick`, `SystemCoreClock`, core id, doorbell IPI, SIO spinlocks. Verified on silicon, single-core and dual-core SMP |
| [`raspberrypi/rp235x_riscv`](raspberry-pi.md#the-rp2350-risc-v-package) | RP2350, RP2354 - Hazard3 RISC-V cores | The same chip, the other core: the machine software interrupt instead of PendSV, the tick off `SIO_MTIMECMP`, SIO spinlocks, and the context-switch handler placed in RAM - a link-time requirement on this part, not a preference. Verified on silicon, single-core and dual-core SMP |
| [`raspberrypi/rp2040`](raspberry-pi.md#the-rp2040-package) | RP2040 (Pico, Pico W) | The same group, with the IPI on the SIO FIFO. Verified on silicon, single-core and dual-core SMP |
| [`st/stm32`](stm32.md#the-soc-package) | Every STM32 | CMSIS-Pack startup already gives the kernel its vector, clock and tick, so the package is small: a `SystemCoreClock` refresh at start-up and tickless HAL hooks. Verified on the NUCLEO-H743ZI (M7), H503RB (M33) and G431RB (M4) |

Every one of these has the same three install routes - one command, offline, or
by hand. **[Installing AhuraRTOS](installation.md#pick-your-chip)** is the table
that names all three per chip; each page above then covers what that package
*is*, in the same five sections: Layout, What it supplies, Using it, Notes,
Status.

An unpackaged part is not an unsupported part. Leave `AHURA_SOC` unset, copy
`template/soc_cb.c`, and the kernel behaves as it always has - which is what
keeps [every core on every vendor](platforms.md) true.
