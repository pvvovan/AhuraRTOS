**RP2040, RP2350 and RP2354 - Arm or RISC-V.** Installing the kernel on a Pico
SDK project, and the reference for the three SoC packages that cover these
chips. The [six general installation steps](installation.md) carried out on a
Pico SDK project - except that two of them are already done for you, because the SoC
package supplies the PendSV vector name and the tick. **Three ways to do it -
pick one:**

| | Route | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **[Automatic](#automatic---one-command)** - one command | Any Pico SDK project. Seconds, shows the diff first, safe to re-run |
| **B** | **[Offline](#offline---no-internet-on-the-machine)** - one command, no network | The same project on a machine with no route out: an air-gapped lab, a locked-down corporate network, a CI agent |
| **C** | **[Manual](#manual---step-by-step)** - five steps by hand | When you want to make every edit yourself, or your project does not look like the SDK's template |

All three end in the same place. **No project yet?**
[Starting from a new project](#starting-from-a-new-project) lists the
*New C/C++ Project* wizard settings the kernel is verified against.

## Which chip, which package

One SDK, three packages - the RP2040 and the RP235x are separate silicon
generations, not two steppings, and the RP2350's two core complexes are further
apart still, so the choice is real rather than cosmetic. The installer reads it
out of `PICO_PLATFORM`, then `PICO_BOARD`, and stops with both names if it
cannot tell:

| `PICO_BOARD` / `PICO_PLATFORM` contains | Chip | `AHURA_SOC` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pico2`, `pico_2`, `rp2350`, `rp2354` | RP2350, RP2354 (Cortex-M33) | `raspberrypi/rp235x_arm` | Verified on silicon, single-core **and** dual-core SMP |
| `rp2350-riscv` in `PICO_PLATFORM` | RP2350, RP2354 (Hazard3 RV32) | `raspberrypi/rp235x_riscv` | Verified on silicon, single-core **and** dual-core SMP |
| `pico`, `rp2040` | RP2040 (Cortex-M0+) | `raspberrypi/rp2040` | Verified on silicon, single-core and dual-core SMP |

Each package is described in full in
[The packages, chip by chip](#the-packages-chip-by-chip).

`--soc raspberrypi/rp235x_arm` overrides the detection if your project names its
board some other way.

The commands below were run end to end on a **Pico 2** (RP2350) with Pico SDK
2.3.0 and `arm-none-eabi-gcc` 15.2.

## Starting from a new project

If you are creating the project rather than adding the kernel to one you
already have, the **Raspberry Pi Pico** VS Code extension's *New C/C++ Project*
wizard is the shortest route. These are the settings the kernel was verified
against - the defaults, with two deliberate choices:

**Basic Settings**

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Name | anything | It becomes the `add_executable()` target, which is what the installer links `ahura_kernel` to |
| Board type | **Pico 2** | Sets `PICO_BOARD`, which is where the installer reads the chip from. **Pico** gives an RP2040 and the `raspberrypi/rp2040` package instead |
| Architecture (Pico 2) | **RISC-V unchecked** | The kernel has no RISC-V port. Ticking it selects the Hazard3 cores, and the package stops the build with a message saying so - see [below](#the-two-that-are-not-optional) |
| Pico SDK version | **v2.3.0** | What the kernel is tested against |

**Features** - leave all nine unchecked (SPI, I2C, UART, PIO, DMA, HW
interpolation, HW watchdog, HW timer, HW clocks). They only paste example
snippets into `main.c`, and the installer has to brace-match `main()` to place
the boot calls. Add the peripherals you need afterwards, the ordinary way.

**Stdio support** - tick **Console over UART**. Nothing in the kernel needs it,
but `printf` is how `OS_LOG_*` and the whole [self-test suite](self-test.md)
report, so a project without a console has no way to tell you it is working.
Console over USB works just as well; it is `pico_enable_stdio_usb()` instead,
and it disables other USB use.

**Code generation options** - leave all five unchecked:

| Option | Leave off because |
|---|---|
| Run the program from RAM rather than flash | Nothing in the kernel cares. Either works |
| Use project name as entry point file name | Off gives you `main.c`, which is what every path in this page names. On gives `<project>.c`, and the installer still finds it - it searches for the `.c` that defines `main()`, not for a file name |
| Generate C++ code | Nothing stops you - `ahura.h` carries `extern "C"` and its compile-time assertions and type checks are spelled both ways, so a C++ translation unit including it compiles and links against the C kernel. C is simply what the templates and examples are written in |
| Enable C++ RTTI / exceptions | Only meaningful with the above, and both cost memory |

**Debugger** - **DebugProbe (CMSIS-DAP)**, the default. The kernel does not care
which probe you use; this only decides what the extension writes into
`launch.json`.

**CMake Tools** - leave *Enable CMake-Tools extension integration* unchecked.
The kernel block goes at the end of the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` either way,
but the plain layout is the one the installer's anchors were written against.

That gives you exactly the project this page assumes: `CMakeLists.txt`,
`pico_sdk_import.cmake` and `main.c` in one directory, `PICO_BOARD` set to
`pico2`, and a `printf` that comes out of UART0 at 115200 8N1. Now run the
[one command](#automatic---one-command).

### The two that are not optional

Everything above is a preference except these:

- **RISC-V must stay off.** `raspberrypi/rp235x_arm` is the Arm side of the
  chip, and almost everything the kernel touches would change on Hazard3 -
  `isr_pendsv` and `isr_systick` are Cortex-M vectors with no RISC-V
  counterpart, and the IPI is armed through the NVIC. The package refuses the
  build rather than producing one that misbehaves:

  ```text
  CMake Error: AHURA_SOC=raspberrypi/rp235x_arm selected with PICO_PLATFORM='rp2350-riscv'.
  This package is the Arm side of the RP235x, and the kernel has no RISC-V port yet in any case.
  Build for the Cortex-M33 side instead (PICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-arm-s).
  ```

- **The board type has to match the chip.** Selecting `Pico` and then forcing
  `--soc raspberrypi/rp235x_arm` (or the reverse) is caught the same way, at
  configure time, because the two packages arm different inter-core hardware.

---

## Automatic - one command

Run it from the root of your project - the directory holding the top-level
`CMakeLists.txt` and `pico_sdk_import.cmake`.

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhuraRTOS/AhuraRTOS/main/tools/install_rpi_online.py | python -
```

**Linux and macOS** (bash, zsh):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhuraRTOS/AhuraRTOS/main/tools/install_rpi_online.py | python3 -
```

That is the whole thing. It prints the exact diff it wants to apply and waits
for a `y` before touching anything. Python 3.8+ and nothing else - no
`pip install`, and the script runs straight out of the pipe, so no installer
file is left behind in your project.

It opens by saying what it worked out, and that is worth reading before you
answer `y`:

```text
AhuraRTOS installer
  project   /home/me/MyPicoProject
  board     pico2
  soc       raspberrypi/rp235x_arm
  target    my_firmware
  sources   main.c
```

### What it does

| Step | |
|---|---|
| 1 | Puts the AhuraRTOS repository at `AhuraRTOS/` in your project |
| 2 | Copies `os_config.h`, `os_cb.c` and `os_main.c` next to your `main.c`, plus the package's `soc_config.h` |
| 3 | Appends the kernel block to the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, with `set(AHURA_SOC ...)` chosen from the board |
| 4 | Calls `os_init()` / `os_start()` in `main()`, ahead of its first loop |
| 5 | Leaves the build to you |

**There is no PendSV step and no tick step**, which is why this is shorter than
the [STM32 procedure](stm32.md). CubeMX generates a competing
`PendSV_Handler` that has to be disabled; the SDK's `crt0.S` declares its vector
entry `isr_pendsv` **weak**, so the kernel's port simply replaces it at link
time. The kernel does have to be *told* that name, and `set(AHURA_SOC ...)` in
step 3 is what tells it. The tick goes the same way: the SDK generates no
`SysTick_Handler` to patch, so the package supplies `isr_systick` instead.

### Options

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Print the diff and stop. Writes nothing |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip the confirmation |
| `--soc PKG` | Force the package: `raspberrypi/rp2040` or `raspberrypi/rp235x_arm` |
| `--ref REF` | Branch or tag to download (default: `main`) |
| `--project DIR` | Project root (default: the current directory) |
| `--source PATH` | Use this checkout instead of downloading |
| `--update` | Replace an `AhuraRTOS/` already in the project with the current version |
| `--force-templates` | Overwrite an existing `os_config.h` / `soc_config.h` / `os_cb.c` / `os_main.c` |
| `--uninstall` | Take the whole integration back out |

They go after the `-`, which is where the pipe leaves room for the script's own
arguments:

```bash
curl -fsSL .../tools/install_rpi_online.py | python3 - --dry-run
```

A saved copy takes them the same way, without the `-`:

```bash
python3 install_rpi_online.py --dry-run
```

### Running it twice

Nothing happens twice. Each run works out what is already in place and fills in
only what is missing:

| Already there | What the next run does |
|---|---|
| `AhuraRTOS/` | Left exactly as it is - `--update` replaces it |
| `os_config.h`, `soc_config.h`, `os_cb.c`, `os_main.c` | Kept, never overwritten - they are yours the moment they exist |
| The CMake block, the boot calls | Rebuilt at the correct anchor, so a call that was moved or lost comes back |

With everything in place it does no work and no network access at all, and says
so. That last row is also the repair: if a block gets deleted by hand, run the
command again.

### What it will not do

**It never overwrites your files.** Once `os_config.h`, `soc_config.h`,
`os_cb.c` and `os_main.c` exist they are yours, edits and all.

**It never copies `template/soc_cb.c`.** That file is the SoC half of the
callback contract, and the selected `raspberrypi` package *is* that file for
these chips. A second definition of every SoC callback in the application would
silently displace the package's real one - an empty weak stub compiled into the
executable beats a real one sitting in an archive - and on SMP that reads as
every core reporting id 0. See [SoC packages](soc.md#the-one-definition-rule).

**It never guesses the chip.** An unrecognised board is an error naming both
packages, because picking the wrong one is not a near miss: it would arm the
wrong inter-core interrupt and build against the wrong core.

**It never writes a build that would not start.** A Pico `main.c` is written by
hand, so there is no `USER CODE` marker to aim at. The installer brace-matches
`main()`, puts the boot calls in front of its first loop, and then *checks* that
`os_init()` and `os_start()` really landed inside `main()`, in that order, and
above the loop - refusing to write if not.

It stops with an explanation, **before writing anything**, if the project does
not call `pico_sdk_init()`, if FreeRTOS is already in it, or if `main()` cannot
be brace-matched.

Installed? Go straight to **[Build and flash](#5-build-and-flash)**.

## Offline - no internet on the machine

Same installation, same result - the only difference is where the kernel comes
from. `install_rpi_offline.py` never touches the network: it uses a copy of the
repository already on the machine, and it does not import `urllib`, `tarfile`
or `socket` to do it, so "offline" is a property of the file rather than a
promise in a comment.

Use it on an air-gapped lab machine, behind a corporate proxy that blocks
GitHub, or on a build agent with no route out.

### 1. Get the repository, on a machine that has a connection

Either a clone or the green **Code → Download ZIP** button:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhuraRTOS/AhuraRTOS.git
```

### 2. Copy it into your project and run it

```text
MyPicoProject/
├── CMakeLists.txt        <- the top-level one
├── pico_sdk_import.cmake
├── main.c
└── AhuraRTOS/            <- the repository you copied in
    ├── ahura.h
    ├── kernel/  arch/  soc/  template/
    └── tools/install_rpi_offline.py
```

```bash
cd MyPicoProject
python3 AhuraRTOS/tools/install_rpi_offline.py
```

On Windows:

```powershell
cd MyPicoProject
python AhuraRTOS\tools\install_rpi_offline.py
```

It names where it found the kernel, on a line the online installer has no need
for, and is otherwise identical:

```text
AhuraRTOS installer (offline)
  project   /home/me/MyPicoProject
  kernel    AhuraRTOS
  board     pico2
  soc       raspberrypi/rp235x_arm
  target    my_firmware
  sources   main.c
```

That is the whole procedure. It finds the kernel beside itself, reads the
project, prints the same diff and waits for a `y` - exactly like the online
installer, because it *is* the online installer: everything that reads the
project, computes the edits and writes them with rollback is imported from
`install_rpi_online.py`. Only the "where does the kernel come from" step
differs, so the two cannot drift apart.

A ZIP download unpacks as `AhuraRTOS-main/` rather than `AhuraRTOS/`. That works
too - it is found under either name, and installed to `AhuraRTOS/` so the CMake
block matches what the online installer would have written.

### Where it looks for the kernel

In this order, most explicit first, stopping at the first real checkout:

| | Location |
|---|---|
| 1 | `--source PATH`, if given. A path that is not a checkout is an **error**, never a reason to keep looking - silently installing some other copy is how the wrong kernel version ends up in a build |
| 2 | The checkout this script is running from |
| 3 | `<project>/AhuraRTOS` |
| 4 | `<project>/AhuraRTOS*` - a ZIP still under its branch name |
| 5 | Next to the project, one level up, under either name - for when several projects share one downloaded copy |

If none of them holds a kernel it says so and stops. It will not download one;
that is the entire point of this script.

### Already in the right place

Offline, the source and the destination are routinely the **same directory**:
the repository is at `<project>/AhuraRTOS`, which is exactly where the installer
would otherwise copy it. Copying a directory onto itself is not a copy - the
destination is cleared first, so it would destroy the source.

So "already in place" is treated as nothing to copy, and any copy whose source
and destination resolve to one path is refused. Symlinks, junctions and Windows
paths differing only in case are all resolved before that comparison, so none of
them slips past as a different directory.

```text
  note: the kernel is already at AhuraRTOS/ - installed in place, nothing copied
```

### Offline options

The same as the online installer, minus `--ref` - there is nothing to fetch:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Print the diff and stop. Writes nothing |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip the confirmation |
| `--soc PKG` | Force the package: `raspberrypi/rp2040` or `raspberrypi/rp235x_arm` |
| `--source PATH` | Use this checkout, wherever it is |
| `--project DIR` | Project root (default: the current directory) |
| `--update` | Refresh `AhuraRTOS/` in the project from `--source` |
| `--force-templates` | Overwrite an existing `os_config.h` / `soc_config.h` / `os_cb.c` / `os_main.c` |
| `--uninstall` | Take the whole integration back out |

`--uninstall` needs no kernel at all - it only removes managed blocks and the
installed directory - so it keeps working on a machine where the original
download has since been deleted.

---

## Manual - step by step

The same result by hand: five steps, not six, because the SoC package answers
the PendSV and tick steps for you.

### 1. Add the kernel to the project

From the project root, copy a clone of AhuraRTOS in as `AhuraRTOS/`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhuraRTOS/AhuraRTOS.git AhuraRTOS
rm -rf AhuraRTOS/.git      # or keep it, and update with git pull
```

A submodule works the same way - see
[Installation → step 1](installation.md#step-1---get-the-source).

### 2. Copy four files

Three are the usual ones; the fourth is the package's own options. Put them
beside your `main.c`:

| Copy this template | into your project as |
|---|---|
| `AhuraRTOS/template/os_config.h` | `os_config.h` |
| `AhuraRTOS/template/os_cb.c` | `os_cb.c` |
| `AhuraRTOS/template/os_main.c` | `os_main.c` |
| `AhuraRTOS/soc/raspberrypi/<chip>/template/soc_config.h` | `soc_config.h` |

`<chip>` is `rp235x_arm` or `rp2040`, from
[the table above](#which-chip-which-package).

**Do not copy `template/soc_cb.c`.** The package is that file for these
chips - see [what it will not do](#what-it-will-not-do) above.

`soc_config.h` is required, and so is every option in it: a missing one is a
compile error rather than a silent default. It is short, and every option
arrives at a sensible value:

| Option | What it decides |
|---|---|
| `SOC_CONFIG_SPINLOCK_ID` | Which SDK lock id the kernel takes - `PICO_SPINLOCK_ID_OS1`, which the SDK reserves for exactly this |
| `SOC_CONFIG_SYSTICK_VECTOR` | Whether the package defines `isr_systick` for you. `0` to write your own |
| `SOC_CONFIG_CLOCK_AUTO_UPDATE` | Whether start-up reads the live `clk_sys` into `SystemCoreClock` - which is what makes a `set_sys_clock_khz()` in `main()` come out right in the tick period |
| `SOC_CONFIG_IPI_DOORBELL` | RP2350 only: carry the inter-core nudge on a claimed doorbell, or `0` for the SIO FIFO. The RP2040 has no doorbells, so its package has no such option |
| `SOC_CONFIG_FAULT_REPORT` | Whether the package installs its own HardFault vector, printing the faulting core, the address and the fault status. The SDK's default is a breakpoint, which with no debugger attached stops the core silently - and a core that faulted looks exactly like a core that never started |

### 3. Add the block to `CMakeLists.txt`

At the **end** of the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, after `pico_sdk_init()` and
after your `add_executable()`. `target_sources()` and `target_link_libraries()`
both *append*, so the only ordering requirement is that the target already
exists:

```cmake
# The SoC package: this is what tells the kernel the SDK's vector table calls
# entry 14 isr_pendsv, not PendSV_Handler. Without it the build links cleanly
# and then traps at os_start(). It also supplies isr_systick, SystemCoreClock,
# the core id, the inter-core doorbell and the SIO spinlocks.
set(AHURA_SOC raspberrypi/rp235x_arm)

# OS_CONFIG_DIR must be set BEFORE add_subdirectory, so the kernel library and
# the application compile against the same os_config.h.
set(OS_CONFIG_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
add_subdirectory(AhuraRTOS)

# Editing os_config.h then re-runs CMake by itself.
set_property(DIRECTORY APPEND PROPERTY CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS ${OS_CONFIG_DIR}/os_config.h)

# Application-owned kernel files: the APPLICATION build, never the kernel library.
target_sources(my_firmware PRIVATE
    os_cb.c
    os_main.c
)

target_link_libraries(my_firmware ahura_kernel)
```

Replace `my_firmware` with the name in your `add_executable()`, and
`raspberrypi/rp235x_arm` with your chip's package.

To build the [self-test suite](self-test.md) as well, add
`add_subdirectory(AhuraRTOS/test)` and link `os_test`. The installer
writes that conditionally, driven by `OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE` in `os_config.h`,
so there is only one switch to flip.

### 4. Boot the kernel in `main.c`

One include, two calls, above whatever loop you already have:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "pico/stdlib.h"
#include "ahura.h"

int main(void)
{
    stdio_init_all();

    os_init();     /* the package's start-up runs inside here */
    os_start();    /* never returns */
}
```

There is nothing SoC-specific to call. The package hooks `os_init()` through
`os_arch_soc_init_cb()`, so the CPU clock, the hardware spinlock and this core's
inter-core interrupt are all ready before the tick is programmed.

Your application code goes in `os_main()`, which is already running as a task:

```c
void os_main(void)
{
    while (1)
    {
        printf("tick\n");
        os_delay_ms(500U);
    }
}
```

### 5. Build and flash

With the Raspberry Pi Pico VS Code extension, the usual **Compile** button is
enough. From a shell, with `cmake`, `ninja` and the SDK's toolchain on `PATH`:

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

The configure log should name the package, the port and the vector it took:

```text
-- Ahura SoC package: raspberrypi/rp235x_arm (Raspberry Pi RP2350 / RP2354, Arm cores)
-- Ahura kernel arch: arm/cortex_m33
-- Ahura PendSV vector: isr_pendsv
```

`isr_pendsv` on that last line is the whole reason the package exists. If it
says `PendSV_Handler`, `AHURA_SOC` did not reach the kernel and the build will
trap at `os_start()`.

`pico_add_extra_outputs()` gives you `build/my_firmware.uf2`. Hold **BOOTSEL**,
plug the board in, and copy it to the mass-storage device that appears - or,
with `picotool` installed:

```bash
picotool load -f build/my_firmware.uf2
```

Output goes wherever `pico_enable_stdio_uart()` / `pico_enable_stdio_usb()` sent
it, at 115200 8N1.

---

## Running both cores

`OS_CONFIG_CORE_COUNT` at `2` in `os_config.h` is the whole of it. `os_start()`
boots the second core through `os_arch_core_launch_cb()`, which the package
implements - there is no call for the application to make, and none to forget.

The package validates that choice against `SOC_CORE_COUNT`, the fact about the
chip, so asking for more cores than the silicon has is a compile error. Running
single-core on a dual-core chip stays entirely reasonable, and is the default.

Both paths have run the full [self-test suite](self-test.md) on RP2350 silicon,
including its dedicated cross-core stress section - contention, wake integrity,
migration and churn.

## The packages, chip by chip

Everything above is the same on all three packages. This section is what each
one *is* - the files it compiles, what it hands the kernel, and what has run on
silicon.

**Splitting on the chip rather than `#if`-ing one file is deliberate.** The
RP2040 and the RP235x are separate silicon generations, not two steppings -
Cortex-M0+ against Cortex-M33, no Security Extension against TrustZone, no
doorbells against doorbells. And the RP2350's two core complexes are further
apart still: on Hazard3 there is no PendSV, no SysTick, no `WFI` on the same
terms, and a fault report with nothing in common.

### What your application owes any of them

The same three rules on every chip here:

```c
#include "ahura.h"

int main(void)
{
    stdio_init_all();

    os_init();                 /* the package's start-up runs inside here */
    os_start();                /* does not return */
}
```

- Copy `template/os_cb.c` for your own half of the callback contract - log
  output, assertions, stack overflow.
- Do **not** copy `template/soc_cb.c`. The package *is* that file for these
  chips, and copying it as well is the `multiple definition` in the table below.
- Copy the package's `template/soc_config.h` beside your `os_config.h`. It is
  required, and so is every option in it - a missing one is a compile error,
  never a silent default.

`OS_CONFIG_CORE_COUNT` at 2 is the whole of enabling the second core, on all
three - see [Running both cores](#running-both-cores).

**Cache coherency is not a concern on any of these chips** - there is no data
cache between the cores and SRAM - so the second `OS_CONFIG_CORE_COUNT`
precondition in `os_config.h` is satisfied for free. It is listed because it
very much is not, on parts that do.

### The RP2040 package

```cmake
set(AHURA_SOC raspberrypi/rp2040)
```

The chip in the original Pico and Pico W. Dual Cortex-M0+. Note this is a
**chip** name, not a board: `pico`, `pico_w` and a long tail of third-party
boards all carry an RP2040 and all use this package. There is no `rp2040_riscv`
and never will be, which is why this one carries no architecture suffix.

**Layout** - most of it is `soc/raspberrypi/common/`, compiled in alongside the
file here:

| | |
|---|---|
| `soc/raspberrypi/common/soc_common.c` | Core id, kernel spinlock, `SystemCoreClock`, `isr_systick`, core 1 launch - identical on every RP2 chip, because it is all SIO or plain SDK |
| `soc_cb.c` | The RP2040's inter-core interrupt, carried on the SIO FIFO |

**What it supplies:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Context-switch vector** | `isr_pendsv`. The SDK's `crt0.S` names entry 14 that, not the CMSIS-Pack `PendSV_Handler` the kernel defaults to. Without it the kernel builds cleanly and then **traps at `os_start()`** |
| **Tick** | `isr_systick` calling `os_tick_handler()` |
| **`SystemCoreClock`** | Defined by the package; the SDK only provides it in its optional CMSIS stub, which `pico_stdlib` does not pull in |
| **Core id** | SIO `CPUID` via `get_core_num()` |
| **IPI** | The inter-core FIFO. The handler drains it and pends PendSV |
| **Spinlock** | The SDK's `spin_lock` API under `PICO_SPINLOCK_ID_OS1`, which it reserves for exactly this use. On this chip that resolves to a real SIO hardware spinlock. The Cortex-M0+ has no exclusive instructions at all, so the kernel's built-in backend could not work here in any case |
| **Start-up** | `os_arch_soc_init_cb()`, which the kernel calls from `os_init()`. Nothing for the application to call |

**Status** - the full self-test passes on silicon, single-core and dual-core.

Getting there cost four bugs, all of them in code that had compiled for years
and never executed - which is worth recording, because "it builds" was doing a
lot of unearned work in this package's favour:

- The shared HardFault vector was written in Thumb-2. It cannot assemble for
  ARMv6-M at all, so this package had never been through a compiler.
- The cycle counter synthesized from SysTick only advanced when somebody polled
  it, so a period that elapsed unobserved was lost for good. It ran at a
  hundredth of the CPU clock and could step backwards.
- Core 0 armed its inter-core interrupt before `multicore_launch_core1()`. On
  this chip the IPI shares the FIFO the launch handshake uses, so the handler
  ate the words the launch was still reading and pended a context switch on a
  core with no first task.
- Core 1 armed its own before the kernel had primed PSP, so the first interrupt
  it took drove a context switch through a stack pointer that had never been
  one.

The last two are the same mistake from opposite ends, and neither could appear
on the RP2350: its IPI is a doorbell, entirely separate from the launch FIFO.

### The RP2350 Arm package

```cmake
set(AHURA_SOC raspberrypi/rp235x_arm)
```

The RP2350 and RP2354 running their Cortex-M33 cores - the chips in the Pico 2
and Pico 2 W. `rp235x` covers both because the SDK has no separate platform for
the RP2354: it is an RP2350 die with stacked flash. `_arm` because the same
silicon can boot Hazard3 RISC-V cores instead.

**Layout** - most of it is `soc/raspberrypi/common/`, compiled in alongside the
file here:

| | |
|---|---|
| `soc/raspberrypi/common/soc_common.c` | Core id, kernel spinlock, `SystemCoreClock`, `isr_systick`, core 1 launch - identical on every RP2 chip, because it is all SIO or plain SDK |
| `soc_cb.c` | The RP2350's inter-core interrupt, carried on a claimed doorbell. Also where RP2350-only work lands as it arrives - TrustZone first, since the Cortex-M33 has the Security Extension and the RP2040's M0+ does not |

**What it supplies:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Context-switch vector** | `isr_pendsv`. The SDK's `crt0.S` names entry 14 that, not the CMSIS-Pack `PendSV_Handler` the kernel defaults to. Without it the kernel builds cleanly and then **traps at `os_start()`** |
| **Tick** | `isr_systick` calling `os_tick_handler()` |
| **`SystemCoreClock`** | Defined by the package; the SDK only provides it in its optional CMSIS stub, which `pico_stdlib` does not pull in |
| **Core id** | SIO `CPUID` via `get_core_num()` |
| **IPI** | A claimed doorbell, the chip's purpose-built inter-core interrupt, leaving the FIFO free for the SDK. `SOC_CONFIG_IPI_DOORBELL 0` falls back to the FIFO |
| **Spinlock** | The SDK's `spin_lock` API under `PICO_SPINLOCK_ID_OS1`, which it reserves for exactly this use. On this chip the SDK defaults `PICO_USE_SW_SPIN_LOCKS` to 1 because of **errata E2**, so it is a software lock built on `LDAEXB`/`STREXB`. Going through the SDK's API is what makes the kernel inherit that workaround |
| **Start-up** | `os_arch_soc_init_cb()`, which the kernel calls from `os_init()`. Nothing for the application to call |

**Status** - both paths have run the full self-test on real silicon:
single-core, and dual-core SMP including the suite's dedicated cross-core stress
section (contention, wake integrity, migration, churn).

### The RP2350 RISC-V package

```cmake
set(AHURA_SOC raspberrypi/rp235x_riscv)
```

The same RP2350 / RP2354 running their two Hazard3 RISC-V cores instead of their
two Cortex-M33s. Same die, same package, same board: an RP2350 ships both core
complexes and boots one of them, chosen by `PICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-riscv` at build
time:

```bash
cmake -B build -DPICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-riscv -DPICO_BOARD=pico2
```

The Pico VS Code extension and the CMake cache both express it the same way. The
package refuses a build for the wrong core rather than producing one that links
and then misbehaves: selecting it with `PICO_PLATFORM` set to anything but a
RISC-V platform is a `FATAL_ERROR` naming both the mistake and the fix.

**Layout** - unlike the Arm sibling this package does **not** compile in
`soc/raspberrypi/common/`: that file is SysTick, CMSIS `SystemCoreClock` and
`isr_pendsv`, none of which exist on this core.

| | |
|---|---|
| `soc_cb.c` | The whole package. Machine software interrupt, `mtime`/`mtimecmp` tick, `mhartid` core id, SIO spinlocks, per-core trap stacks, fault report |

**What it supplies:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Context-switch vector** | The machine software interrupt, trap cause 3. `crt0_riscv.S` names it `isr_riscv_machine_soft_irq` and declares it weak, so the port's handler simply replaces it at link time - there is no vector name to set, because that name is already the RISC-V port's default |
| **Tick** | `mtime`/`mtimecmp`, taken as ordinary system IRQ 29 (`SIO_IRQ_MTIMECMP`) rather than on `mip.MTIP` - see below. Installed as a *shared* handler, so an application handler already on that line is not displaced |
| **CPU clock** | `os_arch_clock_hz_get()` off the live `clk_sys` |
| **Core id** | `mhartid`, read inline by the kernel as a single CSR instruction. The package sets `OS_CONFIG_ARCH_CORE_ID_MHARTID` to say the two agree on this chip - the RISC-V spec does not promise it in general - and verifies the claim against SIO `CPUID` once per core at boot. `os_critical_enter()` and `os_critical_exit()` each need this core's index, so every kernel operation that takes a critical section pays for it twice; a CSR read costs one instruction where a callback costs a cross-module call and a bus access |
| **Yield and IPI** | One register, `SIO_RISCV_SOFTIRQ`. It carries a set bit and a clear bit **per core**, so "reschedule me" and "reschedule the other core" are the same write with a different bit - which is why `os_arch_swi_request_cb()` and `os_arch_core_ipi_request_cb()` are one line each here, where the Arm side needs PendSV plus a doorbell |
| **Spinlock** | The SDK's `spin_lock` API under `SOC_CONFIG_SPINLOCK_ID` (`PICO_SPINLOCK_ID_OS1`, which the SDK reserves for exactly this). Going through the SDK is what makes the kernel inherit the errata workarounds it carries for these locks, instead of keeping a second copy in the port's own `lr.w`/`sc.w` |
| **Trap stack** | One per secondary core, sized by `SOC_CONFIG_HANDLER_STACK_SIZE` |
| **Start-up** | `os_arch_soc_init_cb()`, called by the kernel from `os_init()`. Nothing for the application to call |

**Two decisions worth knowing.**

*The context-switch handler is placed in RAM*, and on this chip that is a
link-time requirement rather than a preference. The SDK puts the vectored
`mtvec` table in `.data` unless `PICO_NO_RAM_VECTOR_TABLE` is set, while code
runs from flash - and those two are 256 MB apart. Each table entry is a `JAL`,
which reaches ±1 MB, so a handler left in `.text` does not link:
*relocation truncated to fit*. The package therefore sets

```cmake
OS_CONFIG_ARCH_SWI_SECTION=".time_critical.ahura_switch"
```

`.time_critical` is the SDK's own RAM-code section, the one
`__not_in_flash_func()` uses, so the handler lands near the table. It is also
where an RTOS wants its context switch anyway - the hottest path in the kernel
stops paying XIP latency on every switch.

*The tick is an external IRQ, not `mip.MTIP`.* `mtimecmp` can reach the core
either way, and this package takes IRQ 29 for two reasons. The SDK recommends it
- `crt0_riscv.S` says of MTIP that IRQ 29 "may be a better option, because it
plays nicely with interrupt preemption". And it is what keeps `os_arch_in_isr()`
correct: that function reads Hazard3's `meicontext`, which accounts for external
IRQs and knows nothing about MTIP. A tick arriving on cause 7 would run with the
kernel believing it was in task context.

The comparator is armed per core, because `mtimecmp` is core-local - the
datasheet is explicit that each core gets its own copy, routed to its own
interrupt line - while the timer itself is shared and is enabled once, from
core 0. It counts `clk_sys` rather than the 1 MHz `ticks` reference, so the tick
period derives from the same number `os_arch_clock_hz_get()` reports and the
kernel already uses for its microsecond waits.

**Status** - the full self-test passes on silicon, single-core and dual-core,
including the suite's cross-core stress section.

Two bugs stood between it and that, both in code that had never executed: core 1
was launched into `os_start()` - core 0's entry point - instead of
`os_core_start()`, so it never ran `os_arch_init()` and its context-switch
interrupt stayed masked forever; and the tick handler was registered from both
cores into one shared vector table, which would have halved the real tick rate
the moment core 1 did come up.

The RISC-V port is newer than the Arm one. Prove a board with the
[self-test suite](self-test.md) before building on it, which is what that suite
is for.

## If it does not build - or builds and does nothing

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Builds, links, then **traps at `os_start()`** | `set(AHURA_SOC ...)` is missing, so the kernel is still looking for `PendSV_Handler` while the SDK's vector says `isr_pendsv` |
| `No os_config.h found` | Step 2 missed, or `OS_CONFIG_DIR` does not point at it |
| `soc_config.h: No such file` | The package's `soc_config.h` was not copied - it is required |
| `multiple definition of 'os_arch_core_id_get_cb'` (or another SoC callback) | `template/soc_cb.c` was copied as well. Delete it: the package is that file |
| Every core reports id 0 on SMP | A copy of `template/soc_cb.c` from before its callbacks were strong, which linked silently. Delete `soc_cb.c` |
| `undefined reference to 'os_main'` | `os_main.c` is not in the application build (step 3) |
| Runs, but the tick never fires | `SOC_CONFIG_SYSTICK_VECTOR` is `0` and nothing defines `isr_systick` |

The general table in
[Installation → if it does not build](installation.md#if-it-does-not-build)
covers the vendor-independent half.

## Next step

Prove the integration before writing anything on top of it:
**[Run the self-test suite](self-test.md)**. Set `OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE` to `1`
in `os_config.h`, rebuild, and read the console.

### Coordinated Pico 2 Arm DEEP sleep

`raspberrypi/rp235x_arm` supports `OS_CONFIG_TICKLESS_ENABLE=1U` with
`OS_CONFIG_TICKLESS_DEEP_ENABLE=1U` and one or two cores.
With two cores, core 1 cooperates only from its idle task. It saves its interrupt
mask, SysTick control and sleep control, then acknowledges a numbered request.
Core 0 waits at most 100 microseconds for that acknowledgement, without a kernel
lock. A pending interrupt on a parked peer rings core 0's actual IPI; the peer
waits until shared clocks and kernel timekeeping have been restored before
resuming its handlers. Doorbell and FIFO scheduling transports are both supported.

DEEP is an idle preference. A busy peer or a peripheral veto keeps tickless LIGHT
sleep with normal clocks; pending local work may decline the pass. The PLL-off
path requires the normal locked PLL_SYS/XOSC clock tree. It preserves PLL power
state, dividers and sleep control, waits for restored clock selection, and leaves
the crystal running. It does not enter the deepest POWMAN power-off modes.

The port vetoes clock shutdown while DMA is busy, PIO/PWM is enabled, relevant
serial/HSTX activity is active, or other enabled clock slices depend directly on
PLL_SYS. It also vetoes shutdown while the USB controller is enabled: retaining
the USB clock alone does not satisfy the RP2350-E12 system-clock requirement.
See the [RP2350 datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf).
Interrupt-driven UART receive and externally clocked serial slave operation keep
normal clocks. The port does not stop application peripherals to manufacture
eligibility.

For external activity registers cannot identify, such as polled asynchronous UART
receive, the board may define `bool soc_deep_sleep_allowed_cb(void)` and return
false while normal clocks are required. Its default is true. This optional SoC
hook runs with configurable interrupts masked on participating cores and no
kernel lock; it must only inspect state, without waits or kernel API calls.
Ordinary pre/post-sleep hooks still handle board preparation and restoration.

The `OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE=1U` image retains `soc_sleep_deep_entries` for debugger
inspection. It increments when PLL_SYS is actually powered down; LIGHT fallbacks
do not increment it. Board acceptance should check this count increases with both
cores idle, that a busy peer/peripheral leaves it unchanged, and that a core-1-only
interrupt promptly wakes the system without losing its handler or data. Repeat
sleep/wake cycles and compare elapsed time against an external reference, checking
both cores remain alive and measuring power. Compiler and deterministic protocol
tests do not substitute for these hardware checks.

RP2040 and RP235x RISC-V DEEP support are unchanged by this implementation.
