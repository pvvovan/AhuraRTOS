/**
 * @file os_main_log.c
 * @brief Ahura kernel example: buffered debug logging (OS_LOG_*).
 *
 * The point of OS_LOG_* is that logging costs the calling task almost nothing.
 * The line is formatted at the call site into a ring buffer and the call
 * returns; the low-priority kernel task tsk_log drains the buffer in the
 * background and hands finished bytes to os_log_output_cb(), which owns the
 * transport. printf, by contrast, pushes every byte to the UART before it
 * returns, so at 115200 baud an 80-character line stalls the caller for roughly
 * 7 ms, which is more than seven scheduler ticks.
 *
 * This example measures that difference, then shows what happens when logging
 * outruns the transport.
 *
 * Copy this file into the application source tree as os_main.c to run it. Needs
 * OS_CONFIG_LOG_ENABLE=1 in os_config.h, and the application must define
 * os_log_output_cb() (see template/os_cb.c) or the output goes nowhere.
