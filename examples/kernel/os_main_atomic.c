/**
 * @file os_main_atomic.c
 * @brief Ahura kernel example: atomic operations (os_atomic_*).
 *
 * An atomic operation is one no other task, ISR or core can observe half-finished. The classic
 * need is a counter shared by two writers: "count = count + 1" is a load, an add and a store, and
 * anything that preempts between the load and the store makes both writers compute from the same
 * starting value, so one of the two increments simply disappears.
 *
 * This example runs that race deliberately. Two tasks of equal priority round-robin on every tick
 * while both increment the same two counters, one through os_atomic_inc() and one with an ordinary
 * read-modify-write. The atomic total is always exact; the plain one usually is not.
 *
 * On cores with LDREX and STREX (ARMv7-M, ARMv8-M) atomics are lock-free and never mask
 * interrupts. ARMv6-M has no such
 * instructions, so there the operation briefly disables interrupts instead, which is worth
 * knowing before putting one in an ARMv6-M hot path.
 *
 * Copy this file into the application source tree as os_main.c to run it.
