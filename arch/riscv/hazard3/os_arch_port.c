/**
 * @file os_arch_port.c
 * @brief Architecture port for the Hazard3 RISC-V core (RV32IMAC, RP2350).
 *
 * The whole implementation is the shared RV32 file, included textually here exactly as the ARM core
 * folders include their profile's port. Compiling ../common/os_arch_port_rv32.c separately would
 * produce duplicate symbols; the build adds this file only.
 *
 * THIN WRAPPER - DO NOT EDIT HERE. The implementation is the file it includes; an edit here
 * would change this core alone and silently diverge from the others. See doc/design.md.
