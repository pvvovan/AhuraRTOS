 * Two core facts, then the shared RV32 header that reads them. The include stays last on purpose:
 * that header branches on these facts, and one defined after it would silently take the generic
 * path instead.

/*
 * Hazard3 implements Xh3irq, its custom interrupt-controller extension, and that is a property of
 * THIS CORE rather than of the chip around it - so it is stated here, in the core folder, and the
 * shared RV32 file branches on it. A future RISC-V core folder that lacks Xh3irq simply does not
 * define this and gets the generic behaviour.
 *
 * It is not taken from the compiler: -march does not advertise it (the ISA string has no room for
 * vendor extensions), and the Pico SDK's own __hazard3_extension_xh3irq comes from
 * hardware/hazard3/features.h - an SDK header, which the kernel does not depend on by design.
 * Selecting this folder IS the assertion that the core has it.

/*
 * The same reasoning for Hazard3's power-management extension, which carries the block/unblock
 * hint pair (the SDK spells them __wfe/__sev) that the SoC package uses for the tickless deep-sleep
 * rendezvous. Stated here, in the core folder, so the shared RV32 header can emit the real
 * instructions for this core and a neutral fallback for one that lacks them. On any RV32 core the
 * two encodings are nop-compatible hints, so misstating this costs a rendezvous that polls rather
 * than sleeps - the sort of silent failure a core folder must not be able to express.
