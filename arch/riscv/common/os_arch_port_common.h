 *
 *   - h3.block enters the WFI sleep state and additionally wakes when another processor in the

 *     so the instruction falls through instead of sleeping - the same close-the-race property
 *     Arm's event register has.
 *   - A pending-and-enabled interrupt wakes a block exactly as it wakes a WFI, mstatus.MIE or no,
 *     so a parked core still notices scheduler requests and peripheral work while its kernel
 *     mask is held.
 *   - h3.unblock posts to the other processors (and, on the RP2350, back to the sender too), and
 *     touches no interrupt state: it is the one cross-core wake that does NOT alias the

 *
 * The two hint encodings are nop-compatible on any RV32 core, so the fallback below exists for a

 * but not power-optimal, and a package that needs the real thing states it in its core folder.

 *
 * "Am I in an interrupt?" is one CSR read on Cortex-M (IPSR) and genuinely has no architectural
 * answer on RISC-V. The Pico SDK says so in as many words: "there is no way to get the current
 * exception on RISC-V (as there is no such thing -- the hardware does not model the exception
 * lifecycle like on Arm)".
 *
 * The answer therefore comes from two places, OR'd together, and between them they cover every
 * context that can reach a kernel API:
 *
 *   1. The core's interrupt controller, where it has one. On Hazard3 meicontext.NOIRQ is clear
 *      exactly while an external IRQ is being dispatched, which is self-maintaining, correct
 *      through arbitrary nesting, and costs four instructions. THIS is the one that matters,
 *      because every application ISR and the kernel tick arrive as external IRQs.
 *
 *   2. os_arch_isr_nesting, for a trap that is NOT an external IRQ and still wants kernel APIs.
 *      Nothing in the kernel needs it today - the context-switch handler deliberately does not
 *      touch it, since it calls no API that asks and it is the hottest path in the port - but a
 *      tick driven straight off mip.MTIP rather than through the interrupt controller would, and
 *      os_arch_isr_enter/exit() are how such a handler declares itself.
 *
 * Getting this wrong is not loud: os_task_current_get() would hand an ISR a task pointer, and a
 * blocking call from interrupt context would be accepted instead of rejected. Hence two mechanisms
 * rather than a single one that is nearly always right.
