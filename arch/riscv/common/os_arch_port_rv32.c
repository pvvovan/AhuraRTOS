/**
 * @file os_arch_port_rv32.c
 * @brief Shared RV32 port implementation: context switch, task frame, trap entry, atomics.
 *
 * Included textually by each core folder's os_arch_port.c, exactly as the ARM ports are - so this
 * file is never added to a build directly. See arch/riscv/hazard3/os_arch_port.c.
 *
 * WHAT DIFFERS FROM THE ARM PORTS, AND WHY
 *
 * RISC-V stacks NOTHING on a trap. Cortex-M pushes r0-r3/r12/lr/pc/xPSR itself, so its PendSV
 * handler only has to add the callee-saved half. Here the trap entry is responsible for every
 * register the interrupted task could have been using, which is why the frame below is 30 words
 * rather than 17, and why the handler is written as one naked block instead of a few instructions.
 *
 * There is no second stack pointer. Cortex-M's MSP/PSP split gives the ARM port a free "no task has
 * run yet" sentinel (PSP == 0) and a handler that serves both the first start and every later
 * switch. RISC-V has one sp, so the two jobs are two functions here: os_arch_start_first_task()
 * restores a frame and mrets without ever taking a trap, and the software-interrupt handler always
 * performs a real switch. That is simpler than the ARM arrangement, not a workaround for it.
 *
 * There is no FPU context. The Pico SDK builds RISC-V with -mabi=ilp32 and no F extension, so there
 * are no floating-point registers to bank - the lazy-stacking dance the ARMv8-M port performs has
 * nothing to do here.

/* The task frame.
 *
 * Laid down by os_arch_task_stack_initialize() and consumed by the restore path below; the two must
 * agree exactly, so the offsets live here as names rather than as numbers in two places.
 *
 * 30 registers, padded to 32 words so the frame is a multiple of the 16-byte stack alignment the
 * ilp32 ABI requires at every call boundary.
 *
 * gp (x3) and tp (x4) are deliberately absent. Both are set once by the startup code and are the
 * same for every task in a single-address-space kernel, so saving them per switch would cost two
 * words and two accesses to preserve a value that cannot differ. A port that ever grows per-task
 * thread-local storage would add tp here and nowhere else.

/* Tickless idle.
 *
 * Nothing architecture-specific to add: every question arch/common/os_arch_tickless.c asks a port
 * takes its default here. The tick IS the SoC's mtimecmp (the privileged spec deliberately does not
 * say where it lives), so there is no tick register at this layer to mask, no second timer to
 * stretch, and mcycle is architectural so a window costs the cycle counter nothing.
 *
 * This used to be 120 lines saying that in different words, one of which was missing the clamp.
