/**
 * @file os_arch_port_v8m.c
 * @brief Shared port for ARMv8-M mainline (Cortex-M33, M35P) and ARMv8.1-M (M52, M55, M85). A
 *        superset of the v7m port: it adds per-task PSPLIM overflow detection and an MSPLIM guard
 *        for the handler stack. Helium (MVE) needs no extra handling - Q4-Q7 alias s16-s31, which
 *        are already saved, and the hardware lazy-stacks the rest.
 *
 * Textually included by each variant's os_arch_port.c wrapper; ARMv8-M baseline (Cortex-M23) runs
 * the Thumb-1 subset and lives in os_arch_port_v6m.c instead. TrustZone (via OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE)
 * may be disabled, secure, or non-secure - in which case the context switch banks per-task secure
 * state through the tz_context callbacks and the initial frames use the non-secure EXC_RETURN.

/* Context switch handler (PendSV does everything).

 *   [ s16-s31 ]  only when the task was using the FPU (EXC_RETURN bit 4 clear)
 *   PSPLIM       per-task stack limit (always present on ARMv8-M mainline)
 *   r4-r11, EXC_RETURN
 *   [ hardware frame: r0-r3, r12, lr, pc, xpsr, (s0-s15, fpscr) ]
 *
 * Storing EXC_RETURN with the context lets each task keep its own frame type,
 * which is mandatory with -mfloat-abi=hard where any task or the startup code
 * may touch the FPU. os_task_stack_select_next() never returns NULL (the idle
 * task always exists), so the restore path needs no fallback.
 *
 * PendSV is the ONLY exception this kernel takes over, and the PSP == 0
 * sentinel is what lets one handler serve both jobs: zero means no task has
 * run yet, so there is no outgoing context to save and the handler simply
 * installs the first task (the "first start" path below). Every later entry
 * finds a real PSP and performs an ordinary switch. See os_arch_port_v7m.c's
 * equivalent block for why SVC is deliberately left to the application - a
 * point that matters most on exactly this core, where secure firmware
 * (TF-M and the like) routinely uses SVC for its own gateway calls.
 *
 * The first-start path also resets MSP to a clean top, abandoning the boot
 * context it was entered with. The vector table only names ONE initial stack
 * pointer - core 0's - so on a multi-core build the top comes from
 * os_arch_handler_stack_top_cb(), which the SoC layer answers per core. A
 * secondary core that reset from the table instead would park its MSP inside
 * core 0's handler stack and both cores would overwrite each other's frames.

 * dual-core build is core 1's, six kilobytes under core 0's - so core 0's handler overflow used

 *                                       optional on every core this port covers.
 *   2. The enable does not stick        DWT is behind the debug power domain on some devices and

 *                                       yet the counter never advances.
 *
 * All three are checked, in that order, because each is cheaper than the next. The last needs an
 * actual observation, so it spends a bounded handful of loop iterations looking for the counter to
 * move - once, at boot.
