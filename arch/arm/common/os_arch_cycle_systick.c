/**
 * @file os_arch_cycle_systick.c
 * @brief Cycle counter synthesized from SysTick, for cores and devices where DWT CYCCNT is not
 *        available.
 *
 * Textually included by the shared port implementations (os_arch_port_v6m.c, _v7m.c,
 * _v8m.c), the same way each variant's os_arch_port.c includes those. This file is
 * not a translation unit - no include guard, statics the includer uses - so it opens with a
 * #error unless the wrapper that includes it has claimed OS_ARCH_PORT_TRANSLATION_UNIT.
 *
 * v6m has no DWT at all; on v7m and v8m CYCCNT is optional, may sit behind debug power, or may be
 * locked, so those ports fall back here. Only DIFFERENCES between two reads mean anything, and they
 * stay correct across the 32-bit wrap. Callers: os_delay_us(), the busy-wait half of os_delay_ms(),
 * and the benchmark table.
 *
 * Three things here are not obvious, and each was a bug once:
 *
 *   - Whole periods are counted in the TICK INTERRUPT (os_arch_cycle_tick), not by polling
 *     COUNTFLAG, which only reports wraps since the last look.
 *   - The count is PER CORE: each core runs its own SysTick on its own phase, while os_tick_count
 *     belongs to core 0 alone.
 *   - The wrap-to-interrupt lag is closed with ICSR.PENDSTSET, never COUNTFLAG - reading CSR clears
 *     that flag, so using it made the counter step BACKWARDS on alternating reads.
 *
 * What each looked like on hardware: doc/design.md, "The SysTick-derived cycle counter".
