/**
 * @file os_arch_tickless.c
 * @brief The tickless-idle port contract, written once for every architecture.
 *
 * Textually included by each port - directly on RISC-V, through arch/arm/common/os_arch_tickless.c
 * on Arm. Not a translation unit - no include guard, statics the includer uses - so it opens with
 * a #error unless the wrapper that includes it has claimed OS_ARCH_PORT_TRANSLATION_UNIT.
 *
 * The five entry points the kernel calls, written once for every port. They used to be written
 * three times and the copies disagreed about the guards, which is where A2, A6 and A9 came from.
 *
 * A port overrides three things; the defaults below suit a port that owns no tick register:
 *
 *   OS_ARCH_TICKLESS_TICK_SILENCE()/_RESTORE()  silence the tick INTERRUPT for the window
 *   OS_ARCH_TICKLESS_CYCLE_FROM_TICK            1 if the cycle counter is fed BY the tick, so the
 *                                               window has to be credited back to it
 *   OS_ARCH_TICKLESS_SELF_SUPPRESS              1 if the port can stretch its own tick timer
 *                                               (ARMv8-M only) and supplies os_arch_tickless_self_*
 *
 * Three rules live here and nowhere else: a window needs >= 2 ticks and something able to end it;
 * 0 in os_arch_tickless_planned means no window is open; and the elapsed count is CLAMPED to what
 * the window was promised, because an overshooting wake source would push os_tick_count past
 * deadlines that have not expired - late is recoverable, early is not.
 *
 * Full contract: doc/tickless.md.
